"We are so pleased with this diaper ointment; our daughter has never had diaper rash when using this daily and with each change.  I love that it is made with all-natural & organic ingredients, without the harmful chemicals that are included in most commercial baby products.",5,1
I like chewing this after meals since I don't feel like brushing but I don't want cavities either. I feel it makes a difference at cleaning teeth and the Xylitol does protect teeth to some extent. Can't go wrong.,5,1
And here I thought I could only get this spice from HEB in San Antonio...I have been having it sent by friends living and traveling through San Antonio for years now....this product is awesome from eggs to chicken/tuna salad to steak rubs...it adds every bit of flavor and brings out the best in the dish!,5,1
"I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall ""uggh"" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!",5,1
"Addressing the other reviews about crushed and dented cans : all the cans in my case were all in perfect shape.<br /><br />I have only bought Friskies cat food after most of the other 'high quality' pet food companies got caught buying tainted chinese protein. That caused a lot of dead pets. My cats were safer buying Friskies than the more expensive stuff sold at the vet and at the pet stores.<br /><br />This cat food was new to two seven month old adopted strays. Since getting them home from the Humane Society, they have shown an interest in canned cat food, but nothing crazy. This stuff stood out as very different though. They completely emptied their bowls and begged for more. They have not done that on any other type of canned food, so I thought it was worth a mention.",5,1
Good cookie. Very filling so 1 is more than enough. Moist and chewy like a good rasin cookie should be and not overly sweet.,4,1
"I DO NOT WANT TO EVER, AND I DO MEAN EVER, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE ON THIS PLANET EARTH, WANT TO EAT ANY OTHER PEANUT BUTTER THAN THIS ONE.  I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS IN THE PANTRY AT ALL TIMES",5,1
"I love the convenience of ordering my senso coffees through Amazon.  They always arrive quickly, and the price in bulk beats the prices in the stores hands-down.  The only thing that would make it better would be for them to offer Irish coffees in packs of four.  I'd LOVE that.",5,1
This Xylitol product has a very mild sweetness.  It is not bitter at all like some stevia products I have used.  I definitely recommend XyloSweet.,5,1
I recently bought my first set of air plants!  Love them...came nicely packaged!  Had purple blooms bringing lot of joy!  Would be great if accompanied by instructions!  No worries...contacted the seller..email right away regarding care of the plants....hardy plants need misting 2 -3 times a week depending on the humidity....just getting to know these little 'guys and gals'...enjoying them!  I displayed them in candle holders...glass...filled with vase gems and pebbles...looks great...now my husband wants me to make 20 of these as gifts! Must buy!,4,1
"I bought this item and put the seeds inside under a grow light, along with several other different types of seeds. All of the seeds I planted did very well except for these. Of the two packages that I bought each had a less than 50% germination rate. I bought one of my packages from Amazon and the other from Lowes both had the same terrible germination.",1,0
This just tastes like sweet milk - I did not care for it and will not purchase it again.,2,0
"This is my cats' favorite catnip. It doesn't smell as minty as the other brands I've tried. Catnip is in the mint family, but my cats like the ones that are less minty. My boy will lick the stuff up and roll around in it. It calms his anxiety, he is usually really jumpy and nervous, but when he's ""high on 'nip"", he's a real lover boy and more playful. I found it also stimulates his appetite, he's around 8 years old and has seasonal allergies and bad teeth, so he doesn't eat like he used to and is getting skinny. I am trying to find ways to put some weight on him before I take him to the vet. My girl likes it too, she'll eat a few licks, but doesn't get ""high"" off of it. About 20 minutes later, they both pass out into what looks like a very deep and relaxing nap. I grind it up into a powder in my herb grinder (coffee grinder assigned to herbs only) to refresh it and release more essential oils. This also helps it sink into the fibers of their beds, scratchers, and toys. If they're just eating it, I leave it as it is because it's in fairly larger pieces, so it's easier for them to eat, and easier for me to clean up the leftovers. I like that it is certified organic too.<br /><br />The only reason that I took a star off is that it is very expensive on this site. All the Walmarts I've been to carry it, and the last bag I bought was $2.99).I thought I might check here to find some great deal or buy it in bulk, but the list price today is over $10 for an ounce. That is ridiculous. Sometimes I find this brand at grocery stores for around $4, but that is the highest price I have seen for it.",4,1
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1,0
"I came across this in a grocery store last winter, brewed one hot cup, and put it back into the pantry only because I felt too guilty after spending money on it to throw it away. I was surprised that the flavor actually had a sourness to it. I found the tang of the tea very off-putting in a warm format. Why then, did I give the product a 5-star rating? This summer I started drinking iced tea and found that green tea with jasmine made a great cold cup, so I decided to give this a whirl. Delicious and refreshing!! I brew 6 bags in 8 cups of water with 1/2 cup of sugar melted in. The tang, when chilled, gives the tea a nice fruitiness. I will definitely buy this again.",5,1
"I am trying all types of products to use with my Keurig coffee maker and I thought the caramel cappuccino would be a good choice. It was so sweet I couldn't drink it, I had to throw it out. I have a sweet tooth and not much seems to sweet to me. I wasted my money on this and I will be throwing it out as well as the Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino that I bought! Waste of money unless you like super sweet!",1,0
"The price seemed reasonable so the wife and I thought we would give this French Roast a try. We were very disappointed. The aroma and taste were more reminiscent of vending machine coffee. If you are expecting something similar to Starbucks, Tullys or Green Mountain French Roast this coffee is not for you. Very weak and not full bodied like you would expect from a French Roast, even on the strongest setting on our Keurig machine.",1,0
I'm pretty picky about what my cats are fed.  While I have never eaten it myself - my clan of 4 all approve this flavor of Weruva.  My only real problem with it is that the calorie count per can is very low compared to other brands.  This food is pretty pricey anyway and it takes a lot of it to fill them up.  I wish the water content wasn't so high or they calorie content was better so I felt I was getting more value for the money I am spending on this food.,5,1
ordered the 4-12 packs. 2 of the 4 boxes only had 11 packs. Kinda odd to have this problem in one order.,4,1
"While I prefer to eat red curry chicken at a Thai restaurant, this is a very acceptable ingredient to make the dish at home. After scouring the shelves at the local oriental markets this is the only canned sauce I found that doesn't have MSG. It doesn't have the intense flavor of the fresh curry paste, but it will do in a pinch. Note: it's not too spicy; just right for me and I usually order mild at a Thai restaurant.",4,1
"Just small enough, but not too big for my dog. He loves it and it helps keep his teeth clean.",5,1
"It makes amazing waffles.  This is the brand the hotels use.  I used to make them with milk and water 50%-50% but straight water makes nicer waffles.  I can't find this mix in Canada, so when I am heading down to the good ole U.S. of A I order them online and pick them up.  Prime's 2 day shipping makes this possible.",5,1
"Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here).",1,0
"A good tasting chewing gum without without artificial sweeteners or preservatives that stays soft as long as you chew it. Unfortunately, it loses it's flavor.",4,1
I liked these tubs for a few months and then realized that they contain fish oil and gelatin. Why put these products in a VEGETARION seeming food? Beware! I'm going to review all of Gerber's products carefully now. Totally dissapointed with Gerber.,1,0

"Best granola cereal I've ever eaten!  You don't have to soak it before eating, lol.",5,1
"I have just started to give my baby solid food and used this cereal as suggested by almost every ped. I love this cereal because it provides nutrition for my baby and my  baby loves this one because of the flavor and texture. The only thing I don't like is that the producer does not include spoon inside the box to measure, but you can measure by tbs or teaspoon yourself.",4,1
"Excellent flavor, very strong but not bitter.  I recommend this one for anyone that wants a really bold strong coffee.",5,1
"They smell like most dog treats do but with a little bit more of an earthy twist. They're colorful and most of them are about four inches long. My 10 month old West Highland White Terrier loves them but my nine year old Westie, who has bad and missing teeth, keeps getting them stuck in her jaw even when I break them in half for her. They seem to stick more to her teeth than actually in the jaw. I would definitely recommend it as a healthy treat for medium-sized pups.",4,1

"Who says you have to wait for Easter or Halloween? I purchased Almond Joy, Baby Ruth, Butterfinger, KitKat and one more...thinking...I ate it so can't remember. All came packaged as stated, perfect sized bars. Not huge, not mini, but perfect 2-bites sizes. Just like Goldie Locks and the 3 Bears. I ordered this for when company stops over - Everyone loves to choose from my candy dish. Only problem was, I ate more than I shared. Uh oh. Not melted, but I didn't order during a warm time of year. Maybe during the summer, a cold pack is included....We'll see because I intend to order again.<br />Great buy. Great Price. And love the door to door service. I also got a $50 credit when ordering, can't beat that!",5,1
"I ordered this item and paid extra for two day expedited service and it arrived six days later! The whole timing of the gift, which is pretty much like flowers, was lost! I am sorry for the money I paid, and will not order any Candy Depot products again.  Thirty three and a half dollars, completely wasted.  I'll try flowers next time!",1,0
"The price is excellent, but the shipping is too high unless you buy a lot.",5,1
mixing this with Almond milk and vanilla whey protein makes it taste exactly like a milk shake/ smoothy.  The key is to put it either in a blender or a closed waterbottle because it does require a lot of shaking/mixing,5,1
"my 3 dogs love these t"" reats and they are good for them too! The same ingred. that is in ""Angle Eyes"" that keeps the tear stains off my schnauzer and poodle mix's face. They were shipped in a timely manor and exactly as promised. Thank you so much!",5,1
"I decided to serve this coffee with our Thanksgiving desserts.  My family really didn't have a lot to say about it.  I thought it was good enough.  It wasn't spectacular or taste that much different than your normal batch of coffee, especially when you add sugar and creamer.<br />Chocolate coffee?  I feel like chocolate coffee is a luxury. Based on the price, it's more of a gift-type of coffee and not one to ingest on a regular basis.  Could you drink it regularly? Absolutely!  It's not too strong or heavy, and it has a good taste.  If you are considering it for a gift, it will be appreciated and enjoyed.",4,1
"Like all Dove candy, this is delicious. For me, more than 2 per day leads to gas, cramping and explosive diarrhea. So be warned. If you're counting carbs, subtract fiber and sugar alcohol from carb count. (Which leaves you with 3 grams per 5 pieces.) Great for low-carb chocoholics, if you can stand it.",5,1
"All I can say is all the packages were stale and not edible. Total waste of money. Had a sell by date of dec 2012 but nuts and granolas had a very bitter and stale taste. Yucks, double yucks.",1,0
I bought these for the HCG diet.  One stick contains 12.5 calories.  These are excellent and two will help feel full if you drink a bottled water with them.  They're great with a salad or pasta even if you're not on a diet.  Much better than melba toast!,5,1
"Using it as intended with a single serve pod brewer, I found it to be weak but I liked the smell so much I wanted to find another way to try it. I also have a Breville single serve coffeemaker so I decided to brew one by cutting open the pod and using my k-cup. I got a great tasting, strong cup of coffee (very strong, the kind my grandparents always used to say would ""put hair on your chest"").  I just ordered grounds because I really enjoyed the strength and taste of this coffee.  The pods weren't for me, but the coffee was.",4,1
I love this flavor of Chex Mix and for some reason it is very difficult to find Peanut Lovers in local stores -- there's only one place that carries it (Meijer's).<br /><br />These didn't take quite as good as I was expecting.  Maybe they changed the formula.,4,1
"Our dogs love these, we have a minature dachshund and a mix breed that weighs about 50lbs.  THey both love to chew on these, all day every day, I have to buy in bulk.  THey are not messy as they have no filling in the center that crumbles everywhere like other brands!  THey also do not leave any sort of stain.  It's their favorite by far.  GReat for keeping their teeth tarter free too.",5,1
"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.",1,0
"I am always looking for healthy treats for my Wheaten and the fewer ingredients the better. I thought I found the best product when I found Waggin Train Chicken Jerky at Costco. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and, well, it scared the crap out of me. So now, I look for healthy treats with few ingredients, that are made in the US. I feel comfortable giving my dog these treats because I know the ingredients used are regulated. My dog LOVES these and so do I.",5,1
"I had been feeding mostly the chicken jerky treats, feeling good about it since the only ingredient was chicken.  Then I saw the reports of kidney failure linked to the ones made in China.  It's hard to find them made in the USA, and they are much more expensive.  Then I found these.  They are made in the US.  Ingredients are chicken and Vitamin E.  The texture is different, but my dog likes them just as well and they have the added advantage of being ""breakable"", so you can give them smaller portions easily.",5,1
"I love this tea, and drink it hot or cold. There's an almost sweet note to it, the rooibos tea provides some perceived sweetness. The lavender is perfect- it's there, but not too perfumey.<br />A coworker and I discovered our shared love for this tea, and we bought a 6 pack, thinking we could give some as gifts and have a stash for a while. We were right.<br />It's nice to know I won't run out of this tea for another year. If there's an earthquake or other natural disaster, I'll flavor my bottled water with it and pretend I'm fancy.",5,1
of milk chocolate and marzipan (almond paste).  I have tried other brands but this is the very best.  The chocolate is very flavorful and smooth and the marzipan is just almonds and sugar with no fillers.  The only problem is that the bar disappears all too quickly.,5,1
We have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach.  We have tried several kinds of dog food for her and Newman's Own Organic seems to be agreeing with her. So we will continue purchasing this product through Amazon as long as it does.,5,1
"I have long, fine hair, shoulder-length+.<br />If dry it can break when combed/brushed.<br /><br />Before CLEAR, I used shampoos/conditioners by Paul Mitchell [[ASIN:B002N5MI8C Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle] and Pantene [[ASIN:B001F51V3E Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Classic Care, Packaging May Vary, 25.4 -Ounce (Pack of 2)]. They give my hair shine and satisfactory body. And less breaking. I'd hoped to have it look even better, be tougher with CLEAR. So I took a shot.<br /><br />CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy/Nourishing Shampoo with its sales pitch of 'nourishing<br />the scalp' seemed believable, like stimulating/nourishing the scalp. Oops; not-so.<br /><br />Terse instructions say ""when using shampoo and conditioner"" ""apply to wet hair, gently massage into scalp, lather and rinse."" (Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy. I repeated the treatment a week later, just<br />to be sure. Same effects, problems. And there's more:<br /><br />The label said an ingredients list was on the label's back.'Just peel it<br />off'. And it was, evidently rushed to market, upside down and backwards.<br /><br />Last shot at CLEAR: The plastic bottle has an flat oval top. The container came in a fitted, sealed plastic sleeve inside a padded Amazon mailer. Shipping shakes evidently poked the flat top and inside the sleeve was slopped with the gooey white glop.<br /><br />Back to the lab, CLEAR Marketeers. I'll stick with Paul Mitchell and Pantene.",1,0

"The Flavored Coffee Samples were packaged in a paper bag which busted open and several of the coffee's had spilled all over my other products.  These products were the Monster High 1600 Draculaura Doll, and the Monster High Skull Shores Ghoulia Yelps Doll.

Very dissatisfied with the packaging and also didn't get to experience some of the flavors of the coffee..I would have returned the package but like I said the doll was a present and no time to replace the gift.

I ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time. from now on I will order from another vendor and pay for shipping.<br /><br />When I received the package it was stained and 3 cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking, 2 others were questionable and 7 others were severely dented but safe to use( I work in a canning facility so I know how to test vacuum in cans).

Just one drop turned a glass of clear water into a bright orange glass of something that looked suspiciously like Kool Aid.

"I really like this mustard, just as I like the Grey Poupon mustard that also has the seeds.  However, the Grey Poupon comes in a glass jar which (a) requires a condiment spoon or spreader to transfer the contents to your food, and (b) being glass, isn't very safe for travel such as picnics, etc.  In addition, the Inglehoffer container is slightly better shaped than the Grey Poupon jar, so that it takes slightly less room in a picnic bag or lunch bag.  Furthermore, I find even an opened container of Inglehoffer can be stored at room temperature for months without problems, even though I know the instructions don't say so.<br /><br />My husband finds this mustard a little too spicy, but for me it's delightful.  A much healthier sandwich spread than mayo, butter, or my wistful favorite, Brie cheese!!  Works VERY well with gourmet sliced roast beef.  And it's actually a high class condiment to accompany hot roast beef for upscale dinners!  VERY glad to have bought this on Subscribe-n-Save and to have multiple containers circulating in the kitchen, the TV room, the picnic cooler, at work, etc.",5,1

I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.,1,0

"I bought several varieties of these Cavendish & Harvey Drops in the ten-packs, so that I'd have plenty of individual tins to give to co-workers as part of Christmas baskets and to share with my university students (sugar helps them stay awake during those evening classes), and I'm very pleased with the price (as long as it works out to less than $2.50 per tin, which it does for this variety if you buy enough to get the free shipping).<br /><br />The pink grapefruit flavor is particularly popular with my friends and family (some of whom love grapefruit but can't eat the fruit itself anymore because of medicine interactions) AND with my students.  The other clear favorite (judging by which tins get emptied the fastest when I set them out at the beginning of each night class) is the Wild Berry variety.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy the sour cherry and the orange flavors I bought, as well (though possibly not quite as much as I like the grapefruit and wild berry), so as long as the price stays nice, I'll order more of these, probably, in time for Valentine's Day!",4,1

Very nice product<br />full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets,5,1
I had the Tassimo and religously used the starbucks t-disc.  They stopped selling them so I switched to the k-cups.  The extra bold coffee is was better than my starbucks.  So smooth and rich with no after taste.  I can not be more happy!!  I also LOVE the Chai Latte k-cup.  So good!,5,1
I have tried all the coffee people bold varieties and I like Black Tiger and Jet Fuel. The Jet fuel is a little smoother and more distinctive in taste. Definitely my favorite!!! You can't go wrong with this coffee & Keurig is so convenient a winning combination.,5,1
"I bought this product to make my own coconut butter and coconut milk since it is much more economical that way and I can control the quality. I can not even buy regular coconut for this price in a B&M store! There are a few things which stand out and made me buy this. Organic, no sulfites, no sweetener, and it is whole coconut, not the leftovers from the coconut oil factory. I ordered this on a Thursday night and received it Friday afternoon, so typical fast shipping via Prime. This will be a subscription from now on.<br /><br />For coconut butter I use 2 bags. One slightly toasted in a cast iron skillet and the other right into my Vita-Mix. Add a pinch of Himalayan pink sea salt and blend on 7 until desired smoothness is reached.",5,1

Recently, this syrup is no longer available in Delaware so I was glad to find it on Amazon.com.

I've been going through some rough times with my grandma dieing and while it hasn't made it better, it has made it easier to cope with. I wouldn't stop taking this tea for anything!<br /><br />Doesn't taste amazing but I add a little raw honey and it doesn't bother me in the least.",5,1
"My cat is very finicky.  He eats only what he wants to eat and nothing else.  He has, on occasion, practicably starved himself because he didn't like the brand or flavor of food that I bought.  A short time ago he broke his foot, and while he is all better now, the doctors recommended an herbal supplement on days where his arthritis has really bothered him.  Giving him this pill, however, has turned out to be more traumatic experience, if not making the pain even worse then before I gave it to him.  Popping it into the Pill Pockets makes for a much better solution.  He thinks he's getting a treat, and although the first few times he was unwary, he has grown to love the treats and never noticing a pill inside.  I would recommend this to all finicky cats everywhere.",5,1
"This is very Bold and strong! Just the way I like it! No bitter after taste, just good coffee! It is good breakfast coffee for me. I like that Kick-start option.",5,1
"When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some ""Against All Odds"" for both of us!",4,1

"These have really increased in salt over the years - I've been using them occasionally for about 20 years now and after buying them for a quick dinner, that certainly won't be happening again!  The salt, UGH!  May as well go to the ocean and swallow a mouthful, or even the Dead Sea.  I don't normally buy prepackaged items like this because of all the preservatives, but this one is quite ridiculous.  It would really be nice if someone could invent a prepackaged item like this without all the salt and whatever else you don't recognize on the label!  It's just SO unhealthy for kids and adults, especially those with high blood pressure.  PLEASE, we're busy moms.  SOMEONE invent something that's quick, easy, and HEALTHY!  Can't recommend this one - I was asked to not buy them again from a family of hungry boys.  You know, that says about everything!",2,0
"The other day I stopped by the local Pharmaca and this Chococrack was on sale for 2.49$ a bar, so I picked up the last 5. I could eat a bar a day. It's good as your breakfast caffeine and protein, lunch substitute or after dinner dessert. It's pretty much good any time of the day. If you've never tried this then I suggest that you DON'T because you WILL become ADDICTED.",5,1
I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good. It smells incredible when it's brewing but I think that because this isnt a true flavored coffee you come in thinking its going to taste sweet. Its bitter to me and even the  undertones of the cinnamon seem a little tart. I tried even putting creamer and sugar and still found it to be too bitter. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not too good.,2,0
My husband is an art teacher for high school students and I was looking for something he could have in class as a treat but that wasn't corn syrup laden or full of food dyes. I was happy to find these at such a great deal!,5,1
First I love this food. My pup has food allergies and she has gone through many top foods because of it. This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :),5,1
This is the only breakfast cereal I can get all three kids to eat.  In fact when it comes in I have to put their names on the boxes so the oldest does not plough through her two (allocated) boxes within four days.  The kids eat this for desert too.,5,1
"First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add.",5,1
"I'm not sure why it is receiving bad marks, because I love this peanut butter. And I do NOT work for the company. My Trader Joe's no longer carries it, so I'm buying it online. It reminds me of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. If you're expecting it to taste like Skippy, you will be disappointed. It's just different. But, it is very good. Peanuty. And I don't feel like I can tell it's low fat at all. My husband is not a big fan of it, but I had my mother try it and she loves it too. We are both life long peanut butter fanatics. So, I hope this helps.",5,1
"Each piece is smaller than I imagined. Therefore, 40 isn't as good of a deal as I hoped. I'm thinking the pieces range from about a 1/4 inch in thickness to perhaps a 1/3 or just over. Each piece is not very big at all.<br /><br />On the other-hand, Anubis (my dog) seems to really like them.",4,1
"OK to good flavor. Better deal than the rest they sell on Amazon mostly because you get a full 16+ ounces.  Flavor? I'm spoiled because I used to catch and smoke my own but still good. The more I eat the better I like it.<br /><br />I might not find a better value, all considered I'll buy more of this unless I can find better product/value.<br /><br />UPDATE! UPDATE:<br />I ordered this brand again, this time I looked for the expiration date.  I looked very carefully both on the box and on the sealed gold package.  As I have ordered almost every brand Amazon sells and they ALL have a expiration date ranging from 2013 - 2016 but NO DATE on this one.  I was going to sign up for a subscription,  NO WAY now.<br />It doesn't taste like it's 10 years old but who knows?",1,0

"I absolutely love this bar! I have to have snacks that are high in protein to keep my sugar up throughout the day. This is the perfect bar! The flavor is good too, I am not a huge fan of all of Kashi products but this one is one to try. It is a bit high in calories but it leaves me full longer, tastes great and is perfect if your looking for a healthy replacement for a meal or a boost of protein!",5,1
"I rarely review products, however this time, I feel compelled to. We are big fans of Tasty Brand's gummies but these are some of worst tasting cookies I've ever had. The taste is so off that I don't even know how to describe it. It must have something to do with being 100 calories -- I'm not sure. Hopefully, Tasty Brands will rework this recipe and do some focus groups.",1,0
"In reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering why I've never had these issues with Swheat Scoop.  It is the only litter I'll use for my cat.  Why?  Because clay cat litters are dusty, that dust gets in the cat's fur and when licked, goes directly into their digestive tract... and clumps.  My vet has told me of many cats he's treated that eventually died from blocked digestive tracts, due to a build up of clumped clay litter.  He's also advised me that the litters with the ""pearls"" of silicone can, if ingested, cause seizures and other potentially fatal reactions in cats, so I won't use those either.<br /><br />Swheat Scoop won't do that, plus it's much easier on the environment, won't harm anything if you flush it, it keeps the odors away, and it works.  Now, to address a few of the complaints I've seen here...<br /><br />Yes, if you put this in a litter box without a liner, the clumps stick like glue to the bottom.  Simple solution... use recycled or biodegradable liners.  It makes cleaning simple, fast, and much less traumatic.  I would never think to put this in an automatic litter box, because it's wheat, which contains gluten, which gets very clumpy when moist.  But then, I'd never use any CLUMPING litter in an automatic litter box, nor am I one who would ever buy an automatic litter box, either.  It's not that difficult to change a regular box if you use liners.<br /><br />Regarding tracking and the litter getting stuck in kitty's paws... I've never had that problem with my cat.  Sometimes he'll kick a little of the litter out of the box, but nothing the vacuum cleaner won't handle.<br /><br />I have used this for years and never, ever got any with bugs in it... nor have I ever had any issues with bugs getting in it after I opened it at home.  As for directions being found in the bottom of the container... it's simple... you empty the litter box, put in a new liner, fill it with Swheat Scoop about two inches deep, and you're done.  Very simple and very logical.  I scoop and flush the solid waste, then just lift liner and all out when fresh litter is needed.<br /><br />There is so little dust from this litter, you could probably call it dust-free.  However, I would think that anyone allergic or sensitive to wheat or wheat products would risk a reaction to the small amount of dust it makes.  I have all kinds of allergies (though not to wheat) and never once has Swheat Scoop adversely affected me, though.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the only litter I feel safe using for my cat... it's the one my vet recommended, it's safe for the environment and the plumbing, and it's the only one my cat actually likes now, too.  Swheat Scoop has a customer for life here!",5,1
Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.,5,1

"I bought these at a pet store prior to amazon and paid probably double the amount ($6 something). My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it.",5,1
"I bought this tea because it is supposed to have clinical proof that it lowers blood pressure.  I didn't realize that it would be so delicious!  It has a very fruity and tart taste, very similar to cranberry juice, without all the sugar.  Of course, you can add sugar if you like it less tart. I have found that it is best ice cold, although it is drinkable hot too.  The most amazing thing about this purchase is how huge the bag is. You can't really see that from the listing picture. It weighs a solid pound and is almost a foot tall.  SO much tea for the money, this is the best value for hibiscus tea that I have found.  Get it!",5,1
"I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.<br />That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!<br />Terrible presentation for an expensive item.<br />As an aside, none of the cans I received has a ""DOP CERTIFIED"" label but only ""CERTIFIED"" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???",1,0

"The other day, I put a cup of this coffee to brew and walked out of the room for a minute while it brewed.  When I stepped back into the room, it had that WONDERFUL coffee house aroma; you know, the kind that makes you want to get out a great book and sit with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />I've tried quite a few of the Keurig coffee blends.  This is by far the BEST coffee I've had on Keurig so far!  While it does have Hazelnut flavor, it's not overbearing -- it's a subtle hazelnut flavor.  This makes a PERFECT breakfast blend cup of coffee.  It has a smooth flavor.  It is NOT bold.  If you like bold strong coffee, this might seem weak.  However, if you like a smooth cup of coffee, this is wonderful!<br /><br />Enjoy!",5,1
"Wish I had seen that the ingredients included cow's milk...trying to find something that is milk free.  Don't know if this product works as designed with cow's milk, but doesn't do so good with goat's milk following the modified directions for the Yogourmet Yogurt Maker.",2,0
"I really like the convenience of ordering things online and having them delivered. Partly because I'm lazy, but mostly because I am on oxygen and it's very difficult for me to get around.<br /><br />I like ordering dry food items in ""bulk"" because they last a long time.<br /><br />These Easy Mac cups are ideal for someone like me. You simply peal off the seal, take out the cheese package, fill the cup with water up to the line, stick it in the microwave for 3 minutes, add the cheese powder + salt/pepper, and you're done.<br /><br />I also like to combine the Easy Mac with other food items when I want more than just a snack. For example, I might make a microwavable dinner and heat up one of these  Easy Mac cups to go along with it.<br /><br />Also of significant importance to me is the price. At my local grocery store, a 4-pack of Triple Cheese Easy Mac was $4.79 last time I checked, which would be $43.11 for 36 from my local grocery store. (Though I have been able to buy them for $1/each in the past.) But in either case, the current price here on amazon of $34.04 is a better deal ... with free shipping to boot.<br /><br />This is a win-win for me. Convenience and savings.",5,1
"Because of the unhealthy ingredients in this product I would have rated this a ZERO, but that wasn't an option.<br /><br />I bought this product thinking it would be of the same caliber as Mariani cherries, which contains ""dried cherries and sugar.""  I'm not a fan of white sugar, nor do I buy or use it in my home, but at least it's the only other ingredient.<br /><br />After I received my delivery I read the ingredients for this product- ""Mariani Wild Blueberries, 3-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)"", which I neglected to do so before my purchase, but I have done with almost every food item have purchased over the past 25+ years, and I found the following quite disturbing!<br /><br />In addition to the blueberries there are the following ingredients:  1)""Sugar"" (who knows what kind. I can only assume it's refinded white sugar, but it's not as bad as the following 3), 2) ""High Fructose Corn Syrup"" (Nasty stuff this is!), 3) ""Corn Syrup"" (More nasty stuff and also useless), and 4) ""Sucrose"" (also known as ""Splenda"" with the Blueberries, and linked to health problems more than the previous 3 ingredients).<br /><br />ALL 4 of these are unhealthy and should be baned from all foods!<br /><br />I was looking for something natural and healthy. There's 'nothing' natural and healthy about white ""Sugar"", ""High Fructose Corn Syrup"", ""Corn Syrup"", and especially ""Sucrose"" (better know as ""Splenda"")<br /><br />There is quite a bit of information available that proves these 4 ingredients are unhealthy.  Search each one, or search ""artificial sweeteners"", and you will be surprised at the negative effects these have on the health and well being of both humans and animals, despite what the manufacturers claim.<br /><br />Had I read the Amazon product description of the ingredients I would NEVER have bought this product!<br /><br />I will NEVER by this product again, nor will I ever buy ""Mariani Berries 'N Cherries, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12) again!  They contain the same 4 NASTY ingredients as the ""Wild Blueberries"" product does!  And they taste awful!  NOTHING like real unadulterated dried fruit.<br /><br />Mariani:  You should have left nature alone, not tampered with the taste of fresh fruit, and only added some sunflower oil or Vitamin E.<br /><br />P.S.

Given the fact that the instructions for the amount of water are based on what the orzo and broccoli will soak up, the extra chicken didn't do anything to the recipe, and actually made the finished dish a lot better.  So, I advise that you use at least two pounds of chicken when you cook this kit.<br /><br />Also, the instructions advise to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces.  I did that, and they came out pretty big, as in pretty big bite-size.  I advise to cut the chicken into ½-inch pieces, and you'll get better distribution throughout the dish.  Smaller pieces also will cut the cooking time.<br /><br />It cooks up just fine, although my cooking time was quite a bit more than indicated on the box.  Total time for me, from the first of the chicken browning until serving was about an hour.  Consider, though, that I used more chicken than advised which likely affected the overall cooking time as indicated on the box's directions.  Yes, it was worth the prep time and wait.<br /><br />The seasoning ingredients are passable, smelling in the pouch an awful lot like canned parmesan cheese, with a hint of celery and parsley.  The orzo plumped up very nicely and filled out the dish well.  The broccoli florets were the only real surprise in the package, coming in a very small envelope and coming out a lot more like ground-up spice bits than the broccoli I thought I'd be getting.  Actually, the box's depiction is about right in terms of broccoli size and distribution.  This package's broccoli will not suffice for your USDA-recommended vegetable intake; it lends color and a small amount of texture to the dish, but to my experience offered no additional taste.  The product's title is ""chicken and broccoli,"" but the ratio is far from equal.<br /><br />The Velveeta cheez pouch was squishy and cheezy and ample; I was surprised by the amount of cheez I was squeezing into the dish.  But hey, it melted down just fine and mixed in with the dish in no time, glomming it all together super-American-style.  As it did this, I was thinking that mixing it with some cream of mushroom soup, dropping the entire thing into a casserole dish, covering it with a top layer of cheez and some fried onions would really make this something cool; I'll have to try this.  Your results may vary.<br /><br />Taste: This stuff was just fine by itself, although my wife noticed immediately that it was pretty bland.  Like, really bland.  Given that I was cooking this for a review, I intentionally did not experiment with the kit (other than my highly irresponsible and psychotically dangerous use of twice the amount of recipe-specified chicken, and a good three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to cook the chicken, and I didn't drain it, leaving the juices and olive oil to join the dish, which  I recommend you do, too).  Yeah, it's pretty bland, but not bad at all, and it's got a lot of potential.  So, I recommend that you up-spice it to fit your own personal needs.  That might mean some salt and pepper.  If and when I make this again, I'll saut&eacute; some onions with the chicken, maybe add some fresh sliced mushrooms, and I'll definitely drop in some garlic, black pepper, caraway seeds, and maybe even a dash of powdered cayenne pepper to give this dish some action.<br /><br />Bottom line: in the dinner kit market, this one isn't really that remarkable.  Follow the simple instructions and you'll end up with a suitably tasty and largely unremarkable dinner for 3 or 4.  But, make a few tweaks for your personal tastes, and you'll end up with something much better.",4,1
I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.,5,1
"I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0"">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.",5,1
"After loosing well over 50 lbs on Weight Watchers, and being a cookie lover, I found that snackwells offer a good choice for a cookie craving.  I like to buy them in bulk, and prepackaged so there is no question as to how many I have eaten.  Amazon makes it very easy to buy in bulk, as my grocery store no longer sells them in bulk.",5,1
While they are expensive Greenies do the trick for a dogs dental health. We tried a couple other brands and went back to these. The price on Amazon cant be beat. Dog is happy as well and gets excited whenever anyone says Greenie! His breath is so much better after just a day or two of use.,5,1
I absolutely love this brand & the different granola products. My daughter & I are both gluten-free & find this so delicious. It can be great as a cereal or even just on-the-go snack. I have mine for breakfast & she puts hers in a bag to eat dry as a snack at work. Even my non-celiac son eats it on us..,5,1

These prices are outrageous! Complete robbery! Amazon should regulate their sellers. I demand the formation of an Amazon Pricing Police! (not kidding). I only give 5 stars for past memories of how delicious they were as a kid. At these prices I'm afraid I will not ever eat them again *sigh.,5,1

"My two toddler boys LOVE all the Annie's Bunnies (Friends, individuals, cheddar, and gummies).  They are super yummy and are a smart snack choice as they are all-natural.  I LOVE Amazon, but can buy Annies' cheaper in the large box at Target, and in individual bags at Costco.",5,1

"I absolutely love this topping!  Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel is the perfect topping for an ice cream sundae.  I first discovered this stuff at TGI Fridays (it's what they used on the Oreo Madness) and have been in love ever since.  I am a caramel lover and not really a fan of butterscotch but somehow this combination just makes the best tasting caramel ever. I personally can't taste the butterscotch, it just tastes like rich, delicious caramel to me.  If you're a fan of caramel I highly suggest giving it a try.",5,1
"I am forced to be very selective about what type of shampoo and conditioner that I use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp. If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. Some shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well.<br /><br />I usually use Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. This  2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner has a nice scent and lathers very well. It's thinner consistency than most shampoo but it doesn't matter much to me. It is also competitively priced.<br /><br />It has twice the Pyrithione Zinc that most Anti-Dandruff shampoo has, which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it super soft and manageable. I can't say that I noticed any specific benefit to my scalp when compared to some of their other types of shampoo but it certainly leaves my hair softer than any other shampoo / conditioner combo that I have used so far. I believe this will become a regular shampoo for me.",4,1
"You won't believe how good this ""health food"" cereal tastes! Not only is it loaded with protein and low in sugar, it has a fabulous crunch that doesn't get soggy.

"My dog eats holistic Eagle Pack food on a regular basis and we alternate between other Eagle Pack flavors. My husband and I received several samples of this shredded lamb dry dog food at the annual Mutt Strutt in Indianapolis, IN.  The first ingredient was meat and not corn so we tried a bit at a time (we don't want to change his food).  It has a really strong lamb smell to it and it appears really healthy on the ingredient list so we felt it was okay to try as a treat.  The dog food in your hand has some oily residue (possibly to enhance the flavor/taste) but it could be the lamb...<br /><br />This healthy dog food is easy to handle when you are doing fast training exercises and intend to get your hand covered with drool anyway. The food is a good motivator.<br /><br />As for short or long term benefits of the food I don't know but gestational female dogs can eat this food-I'm no vet and i don't know if this dog food is calorie or nutrient dense like puppy food but it is okay for our dog as treats.<br /><br />Because its first ingredient is meat it is already better than the cheap kibble food many dog owners buy- so I would say if you don't have access to Eagle Pack or other holistic dog food this is a good alternative- and leaps and bounds better than cheapo kibble that has corn as the first ingredient.<br /><br />I would assume the shredded dry dog food in other flavors has a similar quality in crunch and texture and oily enhancement on the food. My verdict is it's worth trying out.",5,1
"The product came fairly soon and I've always enjoyed this brand so can't say anything bad about it. I drunk it in my 39th week of pregnancy and was able to go into labor on my own in the midst of being threatned with an induction and bounced back fairly well. I'm not sure if it is directly correlated, but I think that coupled with good exercises and mental preparation helped things to go well.",4,1
"This ""creme de marrons"" is exactly like I remembered. Good quality. Of course you have to know what you are buying.

"Starbucks instant tastes like Starbucks fresh - strong and satisfying. The problem is the expiration date.  I bought this in January and have only until May to drink 50 of them. As I use 2 at a time, that's no problem. I noticed the box was packaged in May 2010, so it's already 6 months old.",4,1

"I used to purchase this food at a local store, but saw it on Amazon for around the same price, plus Amazon had free shipping.  I ordered it on a Monday and it was at my door on Friday.  Beats having to go to the store, lug it to the car, and then bring it into the house.  I was a little worried that ordering it online would give me a close expiration date, but when I received it I saw that the date is still 10 months away, so I'm relieved the food is fresh.  Natural Balance is a great food.  I only buy dog food on the Whole Dog Journal approved list, and this brand makes the grade. No corn, byproducts, glutens, etc.  Plus, I try to stay away from foods containing turkey and rosemary, as I read that these ingredients may bother dogs prone to seizures (I have one such dog). No one dog food is perfect for every dog, but Natural Balance is worth a try!",5,1
"I selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. I was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. It tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces, worse than the other company's. I will never buy anything from this company.",1,0
"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.",5,1
"The product description says, ""assertive, dark, smoky fragrance and flavor"" and they ain't kiddin'!!!  It barely tastes like tea at all... more like they took a cloth, let it hang in campfire smoke for a week, soaked it in hot water and wrung it out into my mug.  Seriously!<br /><br />I've tried taking half of a pinch of this and adding to other tea leaves when I brew a pot. That turns out pretty good.  But straight? You'd better like wood smoke!",1,0

"I am a tea-a-holic, I drink tea all day long, and was looking for a decaf subsitute to my vanilla hazelnut Bigelow.

"My girlfriend and I decided to try 5-hour energy because we both like Red Bull but didn't like the ""crashing"" effect it can have after a little while. First off, Amazon's price is absolutely ridiculous. You should be able to get a 24 pack of this stuff for around $33 (at Sam's, etc.). Secondly, this stuff tastes gross (we had the berry flavored...more like vomit berry favor). Thirdly and MOST importantly: it didn't do anything except make us actually more tired. We couldn't stop yawning about 20 minutes after shooting our drinks down. I've read the negative reviews that other people have written...believe them and save your money! The positive reviews I am convinced are by people who are affected by the placebo effect. They think they should be more awake, so they ""feel"" more energized...",1,0
"This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of ""production notes"" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.",1,0

"As someone who is used to artificial sweeteners, I have to say that these were exactly what I hoped for.  Are they a little extra sweet?  Sure.  But let's be honest, I haven't had real apple cider in years and this was close enough for me.  If you're watching your blood sugar and would like a non-coffee/tea treat for your keurig, I recommend these.  The caramel ones are decent too, although they are stronger than these in my opinion.  A single 24 pack is a fairly reasonable price, try it out for yourself.",5,1
"I don't usually like snack foods with flavored coatings, and I wasn't that into the Bugles with peanut butter and chocolate.  But I think these are very good.  Unlike the pb/chocolate Bugles which are coated with a pasty goo, these just have a pretty light dusting of flavoring.  It does leave some mess on your fingers but it's not too bad.  The individual pieces remain crispy and you can still taste the original Bugle flavor, combined with the nacho cheese flavor.  I think the flavor balance is very well done.  If you've never had Bugles, the pieces are little hollow cornucopia shaped bits, with a sort of cross between a fried and puffy texture, and the flavor is similar to a corn chip, but distinctly unique in its own way.  Also it's a snack food which I don't think is too salty.  The plain Bugles have what I would describe as a mild but appealing flavor; the nacho cheese ones aren't really spicy but have a nice cheese taste without overkill.  The bite texture is similar to something like fritos; they aren't hard, nor are they brittle, but still crunchy.<br /><br />I purchased the carton containing the 4.1 oz. bags, which I find to be too much for one sitting as a snack, but it might be a good individual size bag for some people.  These are a filling kind of snack that can replace the desire for a meal.  Of course it's probably better to have a real meal of uber-healthy foods, but sometimes I really am hungry and just don't feel like cooking.<br /><br />The bags are easy to open without ripping and flinging the contents everywhere.  The product arrived well packaged and everything was in good condition.",4,1

America is at toxic levels with all the sugar in the foods out there and no one is aware of it or cares or even realizes how horrid it is.  This is why we have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems across the board.  This country is in a very sad state.  I'm doing my best to let everyone around me know.

"I haven't owned a dog in over 25 years but I got a puppy in November 2010.  She was rescued (with her brother) because her mother was killed by a coyote.  The woman who rescued her hand fed the puppies with bottles.  When they started eating she put them on Science Diet.  I have read some pretty nasty comments about Science Diet in the reviews.  I agree with a guy that wrote that the results from feeding Science Diet speak for themselves.  My pet is perfectly healthy, full of energy, her stools are just right, and her coat is very shiny.  I guess it would be better if I could afford to have dog food made from products humans would eat. People seem to rave about these dog foods made from all healthy almost human consumable ingredients.  As my puppy is doing so well on this food, I am choosing to leave her with it till adulthood.  Then I will may shop for another brand.  As they say, why fix it if it ain't broke!",4,1

"Simply put, this vending machine is a piece of crap. And, dealing with the company is even worse. Just check the long list of complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. That said here is the breakdown on how the machine works:<br /><br />Coin Mechanism - Most likely the worst Coin Mech in the Vending Business. Anyone with a piece of straw, a paper clip or even with their car keys can easily tamper it and get free candy. After a couple of months of use, it will start jamming and will work with everything BUT quarters. Unlike in the feature description, these plastic coin mechanisms will not last very long with normal use.<br /><br />Chute Doors - The chute doors are made of plastic. Very WEAK plastic. They will not last a week of normal use. This will leave an extremely unattractive machine that looks like a toothless Hockey player. Not to mention how unsanitary that is.<br /><br />Canisters - Sure the easy on, easy off design might be the best any company has come up with. However, the canisters are so weak that I have had them crack on my hands while cleaning them. Another flaw would be that these clear canisters will turn yellowish within a month if exposed to indirect sunlight of strong fluorescent lighting. Even if they aren't, they will still turn yellowish within a year.  Plus, they are very poorly manufactured. Finally these canisters would not only NOT keep the candy fresh, but also it is very easy for insects to get inside and make a total mess.<br /><br />Housing - This would be the piece attached to the metal pole and base and holds the canisters and coin mechs. It is so poorly made, that within a couple of months it will start to crack. I have had customers call me to tell me the machine fell on the floor. Imagine if it had fallen on top of a child!<br /><br />The Back ""Security"" Door - It is incredibly weak and made of plastic. Anyone with a screwdriver can steal your quarters without even breaking it.<br /><br />The Company - The Manufactures are Multivend. They might be one of the worst companies to deal with. As I said before, just read the complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novelty TOY, this machine would be perfect if they didn't want to charge you over $100.00 for each (A new Unit can set you back almost $400.00). I would pay no more than $40.00 for a unit. But, if you are looking for an investment, then look elsewhere. I can recommend the Beaver Machines. Those are the best in the market. I've made more money with around 40 Beaver Units than the over 300 units of Vendstar 3000 Machines I purchased will ever produce.",1,0
"(My very first review...)<br /><br />What I got is different (but better) than the Reed's Ginger Candy picture. This yummy chews comes in a bulk-box of 20 small boxes, and each small box contain 10 candies making a total of 200 candies. Each candy / chew is wrap in an **edible** rice paper and then in a wax paper. I'm very impress with the whole packaging, and the edible rice paper is a nice surprise. I hate those inner-wrapper that comes with most candies making eating-candy a messy experience. The candies are very addictive. The only small complain I have is that the ginger-taste is too mild for me. If you are getting this for morning / motion sickness or migraine, this may not be a good choice.

"I have two cardis, one of whom is a strong chewer. I've always been a believer in the Nylabone toys, having seen my parents give them to their dogs over my entire life. Never had a problem. When my male cardi was a puppy, I gave him a regular bone-shaped Nylabone toy. He prompted chewed a large chunk off the knobby end of the bone and swallowed it. What an expensive fiasco that was. I had to take the Nylabones from him completely... until we found these rings. Now he can enjoy chewing the toy without getting large pieces off. When it looks like he might chew through the ring, I just throw it away and give him a new one. He gets his fix and I don't have to worry!",5,1
"I love this stuff. If you're like me, you LOVE pho but love being healthy too and sometimes the two just don't mesh well together. No, this does not taste EXACTLY like the pho you'll get at a good Vietnamese place...but it's close enough and a lot better for you. I mixed mine with vegetable broth and tofu instead of the standard beef broth and meat trimmings. I would test this out if you're even halfway thinking about it. If you end up hating it, you can send the leftover boxes to me! :P",5,1

"My dogs love these and the smaller pieces are more appropriate for my little terrier than a whole pig's ear.  I also like to avoid raw hide since one of my previous dogs had stomach problems with raw hide.  I haven't noticed any issues with the ear pieces.<br />After looking at grocery and the pet store chains, this is a good price in comparison. I paid about $12 for the pound of Grillerz.",5,1
"I got this to pop in my Whirly Pop stovetop popper, and it works great. This is comparable to the packages sold by the Whirly Pop manufacturer, but much less expensive. A great buy for popcorn lovers. My only complaint is that the packaging is a little awkward in that you pretty much need to cut the popcorn, salt, and oil open and pour them into the popper separately to avoid spilling them all over the place-- but this style packaging seems to be very common from brand to brand.",4,1
"I Love them, and cant find them in stores around here.  So was happy to find them on Amazon. Better than just a salad topper! I crush them and add the to rice for flavor. Plus use them as a crumb topping on many dishes.",5,1

"It's been two weeks since I began bulk aging this Barolo kit and I am impressed so far.  The wine, even at this early stage is very drinkable, and has a beautiful, deep red color.  My only regret is having stabilized it before doing a malolactic fermentation, but I will do that on the next one.<br /><br />I took reviewer Duane's advice and used BM 4X4 yeast which I was able to buy in 30 gram packages from Fermentation Solutions in Campbell, Ca.  I also made this kit to 5.5 gallons and added 1 1/2 lbs of Zante currants (available on Amazon) for body.<br /><br />Though I have two much more expensive Winexpert kits going, I expect I'll be drinking this Barolo as my table wine while the other more expensive kits age.  You won't go wrong buying this kit, and with a few tweaks you'll have a very nice table wine for under 2 bucks a bottle.",5,1

"Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula. Woops! So I went and bought the 15lb bag of Chicken and Rice and mix the Beef and Fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system.<br /><br />I can say that after we started feeding this to my pup, she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before. Also, Roshan's right about the fish breath! Ick.<br /><br />Overall, my dog has no issues with this formula, it's just stinky so I'll stick to Chicken and Rice after this bag is done.",4,1
"I have been taking two chews a day as recommended for about two months and when I had my cholesterol checked, found that my LDL had dropped a great deal.

"I brewed and bottled my first batch of this Merlot.  I added light oak chips to it.  We drank much of it before it ever got to the bottling stage but I did manage to bottle and age 9 bottles for a  little over a month.  It is much better if you can get it bottled for a while.  Even though it says it is a 4 week kit, I'd suggest not rushing it. Good wine is never rushed.  Stretch the fermenting to 4 to 6 weeks before adding stabilizers and clarifiers.  Then leave another few weeks and bottle.  Free shipping is a plus.",5,1
This product works well with most kinds of meat.  Gives a little extra zip to the flavor of the meat.,4,1
I have to give my cat 3 pills a day. Pill pockets are the greatest! I have to use the Salmon flavor though. The chicken just didn't go over very well & once she tried the salmon she wouldn't eat the chicken. I use pill pockets for my dogs too. It so much easier than trying to shove a pill down their throats. It's also a lot less messier than some of the food products I've tried hiding the pills in.,5,1
"I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.  The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor.  The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice.  Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them.",1,0

Came home from a trip to Austria hoping to find this!  It is the MOST yummy mustard ever!  I really didn't think I'd find it but googled it and sure enough .. good old Amazon.com came up with a resource!  I'm going to order some .. it was just TOO fantastic on Austrian sausages .. I'm positive it will be equally as good on any American sandwich I choose to use it with!  YUM!!,5,1
"Brach's Gummies all have same flavor - sweet.<br /><br />(Okay - the yellow did have a hint of something different).<br /><br />The bag states 6 flavors, including grape (fine print) but pictures just 5: yellow, green, red, orange-ish, and light yellow.<br /><br />Contents - nothing that resembles purple (standard expectation of grape).<br /><br />However, although commenting about it (melodramatic flare?) could care less about the colors or the # of flavors.<br /><br />But bothered by the lack of different flavors at all.<br /><br />Further insult: high price for 6#.<br /><br />Want a really good experience? try the Albanese assortment. 12 flavors, all of which can be identified.",1,0
These are my favorite pretzels.  I like the whole-wheat flavor and rough grain texture.  They are also a good size for snacking.  I can never find these in the store so I buy them online.  I have bought several cases and had one off-flavor/stale bag.,4,1
"I was born and grew up in Indianolia, Iowa, which during my youth was a small town just south of Des Moines (its a lot bigger now!).  I have always been a hometown boy!  I love my hometown.  I have VERY fond memories of my hometown.  I would do anything for my hometown.  Imagine my joy when I came across the listing for ""Hometown Favorites"" candy!  How fantastic, an entire box of candy made in my hometown of Indianolia, Iowa!  I figured this would be the greatest box of candy I ever bought, one that would combine my moderate love of sweets and my gigantic love of my hometown.<br /><br />I anticipated the arrival of my candy for several days; each day bring me closer and closer to the edge of expectation overload.  Finally, the candy arrived and I busted open the box furiously pouring over the wide selection of candies and scanning the wrappers for any hint of Indianolia, Iowa.  Imagine my incredible disappointment when my hometown was not mentioned on one single piece of candy or even the box for that matter.  Heatedly, I ran to my computer with my new box of candy.  I typed and typed, my original joy dissipating with each keystroke as i learned one piece of candy after another was manufactured somewhere other than Indianolia!<br /><br />This product description is false advertising!  This candy had NO connection to my hometown of Indianolia.  This product gets one star for suckering me into buying it by capitalizing on my hometown pride.<br /><br />The candy was delicious though.",1,0

"These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!",4,1
"My family loves these chips.  We bought a huge box of them for my son's bar mitzvah and they were a hit at the party.  The company makes a great product and they ship very quickly.  You can buy small bags or larger quantities.  Order them and you will find that not only isn't one chip enough, one bag isn't enough.  Also the price on Amazon is amazing.  Enjoy!",5,1

"Although the selfish part of me wants to save all of these for myself, in fairness this wonderful product deserves a few more reviews.<br /><br />I know that these are often used for cooking, but I purchased this product in lieu of the overpriced and overly-artificial strawberry fruit leathers in little foil wrappers. These ""Dried Apricot Fruit Paste"" packages that I bought contain just apricot, sugar, olive oil, and glucose--a very short list, and contain almost a POUND of fruit per package. That's almost three POUNDS of fruit, rather than foil, fluff, and a few ounces of product.<br /><br />Both my daughter and I love the apricot, and we can enjoy it at any time of the year. I just unwrap some, cut it into pieces with a pair of scissors, and arrange them in a little bowl to enjoy. My daughter always wants seconds, but they're a treat, and sticky, so I limit them the same way as one would with candy.<br /><br />If you enjoy fruit leather for treats, these are AWESOME. Please try them, but also please don't drive up the market price on me too much because I still want to enjoy them.",5,1

"After 6 or 7PM, I tend to be pretty worn out. I saw one of these in my brother's car, and he didn't want it, so I decided to go for it. I drank the whole bottle, and I felt the effects after about 30 min. I didn't have any weird side effects, but I noticed myself twitching a lot. It does some things correctly, as physically I feel decent, but mentally I feel awful. It's the kind of feeling you get when you want to go to sleep, but you can't. The best word to describe it is restless. It also tastes awful, but you can't really mark it down based on taste, as it's not obviously supposed to be something that tastes good.<br /><br />I'll give it a couple of stars for making me feel a little better physically, but that's still questionable, as it also made me very twitchy. Definitely not a product I'd recommend to anyone, unless they felt physically fatigued. A lot of people here seem satisfied with it, so maybe it's just me.",2,0

I love this coconut oil!  It has a delicate coconut aroma and flavor. I have only just started using it but have found it to be delicious when making pancakes in lieu of using butter.  I have also used it as a substitute for butter when making grilled cheese sandwiches and baked sweet potatoes. It will do wonders for your hair and skin too.  I especially like using it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I mix the coconut oil with a few drops of lemon essential oil and rub it into my hair.  It smells like dessert and good for my hair and scalp. Try it with your favorite essential oils!<br /><br />Warning:  It melts at 76F.

"There's nothing wrong with Earth's Best baby foods if you're looking specifically for a wide variety of organic foods and are willing to pay more for that option. However, if you're looking for the best deal monetarily, Earth's Best is rarely the best option. When I saw this large package deal on amazon and looked at the weight listed (11.1 lbs), I did some math and thought I'd be getting 6 oz jars, putting these on the pricey end, but reasonable enough. However, the package I received -- two flats of 12 4 oz. jars of baby food -- had each flat labeled 3 lbs. I'm not sure how two 3 lb. flats become 11.1 lbs, but the result is that I ended up with far less baby food than the weight implied.<br /><br />If you're a regular Earth's Best user and are willing to shell out the extra money for organic baby food to be delivered to your door, this is probably a fine product for you. If you're a mom like me who's looking for ways to cut costs, this isn't one of them.",2,0

Every summer my hair and scalp seems to get very dry which makes my scalp itchy. I've been using this Shampoo and Conditioner for a week now and I've noticed a huge improvement already. The itchiness was gone after the very first use and my hair feels so much healthier now as well.  This Conditioner sure helps in the tangle department as well.  It makes my hair tangle-free and so incredibly soft.<br /><br />I've been having my 10-year-old daughter use these products as well and she keeps going around telling everybody to feel how soft her hair is now. The chlorine from the pools sure drys her hair out in the summertime but after using these products it seems to help out tons. The Conditioner sure helps those awful tangles that she's always fighting.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the scent is something to rave about but it's not bad either.  The Conditioner seems to smell a bit better than the Shampoo does.<br /><br />I really like how much healthier and softer our hair is after using this product and I would recommend it.,5,1

"As a diabetic, I am always looking for sugar free products that don't taste like garbage.  As an ex-New Yorker, And one who was raised on chocolate egg creams, the lack of a good chocolate syrup has been a long search.  This isn't perfect, but it is the very best out there.",4,1
"I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this...",1,0
jet fuel coffee is the best coffee i ever had the taste is great it gets your mornings off to a great start.and you dont have to buy a plane ticket.i think every one should try it.,5,1
"I've tried these a couple times now, and first of all, they are delicious for an energy bar. Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!",5,1
"This product is great if you are looking for a low calorie, high fiber, gluten free bread.  It has a pretty good taste and decent texture.<br />Pro: One of the least expensive gf breads available<br />  Good Fiber content<br />  Low calorie<br />  Decent texture<br />  Decent taste<br />Con: Delicate and dry<br />  Crumbles easily<br /><br />I actually like the crumbly texure, but that might turn others off.  It's a good bread that you can have if you have gluten issues, dont mind dryness, and can't afford some of the more expensive ones.",4,1
These are great sardines!  The olive oil is top notch and the sardines were perfect in the can.<br />While these are filets as described and I normally like the whole fish I have to admit that these guys were very moist and of the highest quality.,5,1
"I tired of buying cans here and there - it is a staple in my house. I make a lot of Thai and Indian dishes and it gets very costly buying individually at the grocery store. Amazon has a great price and fast shipping. If you are looking to lighten up some of your favorite dishes that have regular coconut milk (yum) I definitely recommend switching to the light coconut milk (also yum). The flavor is not as intensely strong, but it still gets the job done. Happy cooking and shopping! Enjoy :)",5,1
"This box dinner was very easy to make and had a very good flavor. I had some leftover chicken which made it much easier and faster to prepare. The only problem I had with it was the broccoli. Tiny little pieces which I probably would not use the next time. I will use fresh or frozen broccoli.<br /><br />The cheese sauce was very good, but I am glad I didn't put all of it in the dish. I really liked the orzo pasta. It was very different than any of the other Kraft Velveeta products I have tried. I wish it didn't have so much sodium in it.<br /><br />I felt it deserved a 4 score because of the above problems. Will try some of the other Skillet Dinner Kits though.",4,1
"Don't know how, don't know why, don't really care, but somehow this tea helps me sleep through the night.  I have what I would call an overactive brain and I used to wake up multiple times a night just thinking about things.<br /><br />Something in this tea shuts that off and allows me to sleep soundly through the night.<br /><br />And I think it tastes good!!",5,1
"I bought a couple of these for a party and did not end up using them.  So they sat in my cupboard for quite some time.  I decided to take them with me on a trip and share with girlfriends.  I did wonder if they would even still be good.  But I did not want to throw them away without at least trying to use them.  I don't think I have ever thrown away chocolate!  The directions were specific about heating this product and I followed them to a ""T"".  Heating 30 seconds at a time in the microwave at a lower power (4-5) and stir after each heat time.  It seems that it might take forever but be patient, it is heating within.  This was a wonderful treat and it tasted wonderful even after all that time of sitting in the cupboard.  We dipped strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, graham cracker sticks and bananas.  It was delicious!  I am buying more just to have on hand and to send to those girlfriends.",5,1
"This is some great stuff. I haven't try the other favors yet, but this favor is great. It doesn't take that much to add favor to the water, which is great, because it lasts longer, but it's the price that kills it for me (Amazon & in-stores). It's basically a overly price Kool-Aid. Hopefully they'll kick down the price, or this stuff might not last that long on the market, seeing how there is other options out there for less that enhance water, and make it taste just as this stuff does.",5,1
"I used to be a mom who, like some of the reviewers of this product, refused to buy anything with sugar in the first three ingredients...then my three year old was diagnosed with Celiac.  EnviroKids has been a livesaver for me because now there are cereals he can eat that make him feel like any other kid.  He takes these in a baggie to pre school for snack from time to time and loves that the other kids want some of what he has!  It is sweet and crunchy, and let,s be honest, there are WAY more unhealthy things our kids could be eating!",5,1
I ordered these after receiving a sample in the mail.  They were delicious!  My husband and I were looking for ways to increase the amount of fiber we get in our diet and this fit the bill.  It also works perfectly for those chocolate and sweet tooth cravings.<br /><br />The chocolate is very rich and you would never know you were eating something healthy.  We order them by the case through Amazon via subscription because it is much cheaper than in the stores and it's much healthier than running to the store for a Snickers!!<br /><br />[...],5,1
"Stash Premium Coconut Mango Wuyi Oolong Tea is right up there with the flavored teas that don't have flavor.  I'm extremely disappointed as I purchased 100-count box. Even doubling and tripling up on tea bags, there's little to no flavor.  I've spent over $53.00 on 4 different flavors of STASH and it's like throwing my money away.",2,0
"This just says yes all over the place. Good price, and the cats just love it. Will most definitely be purchasing this over and over again!",5,1
"The best tasting protein drink i have ever tried.  I order multiple cases from Amazon Prime.  The texture is surprisingly smooth for having so much protein, and the banana tast is excellent.",5,1
"If you don't like a rich roasted flavor, & prefer a lighter really mellow coffee, then this is for you!",4,1
Review sites list this close to the top for pet health.  The only disputed content is tomato pumice and that is argued over.  That's even less likely to contribute because it is well down the ingredients list.  This ranking places it well above many vet and feed store premium items.,5,1
"These are delicious, they did not last long. I brought them into work and between me, my coworkers and a 5 year old, they were gone. The selection of fruits in the mix is well balanced and they are easy to take with you (if you get the chance) in the bags.",5,1
Not much to say. The product is exactly what it is! A nice compliment to the kitchen counters. Pice is very reasonable.,5,1
"these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes.....full flavor, not too acidic and VERY italian!  Always the best choice for italian cooking....",5,1
They are great. There is no work to it. Just add water and wait 20 - 30 minutes and they are ready to cook.  They crisp up on the outside and are great on the inside.  They are just like the potatoes in the restaurants. I will buy this product again when I run out.,5,1
"I bought the Cascabel Sauce in this San Angel line from a Whole Foods market.<br />It is excellent, I fried up some pork chops and onions and ate it with rice and cascabel sauce on the chops. You dont need much sauce as it has extreme, yummy and savory complex flavors. Its just right, well balanced. I love it, will try on chix and steak soon! I did not try the Red or Black Mole' yet.",5,1
"As with pretty much any other steak rub, seasoning, or sauce, garlic dominates Grill Mates' steak rub.  Notably, it only has barely half the sodium in their ""25% less sodium"" Montreal Steak seasoning, which allows it to avoid the overly saltiness of Montreal Steak.  It's also more flavorful.  It has the perfect consistency for a rub (in contrast with the pork rub, which I find too ""thin"").  In fact, it's my favorite of all the Grill Mates seasonings I've tried.",5,1
We will keep these on hand 'always' - best mint candy around by far. (Wouldn't it be great if they were from the U.S.),5,1
"THe noodles were very rubbery & the texture was not at all like food. You could bury it in sauce to make it taste like food, but cant get away from the rubbery texture. I do not recommend this product.",2,0
"The flaxseed meal is excellent quality. As you may know, unless the flaxseeds are ground into a meal the nutritional value is unavailable to the body.<br /><br />This product is great. Highly recommended.",5,1
"I've had many other coconut waters, all of which had added flavor.  But this one I can't choke down....I like the others I've had, I really don't like this one!",1,0
"My cats love this cat food and it's loaded with juicy gravy, which my male cat needs to keep from getting urinary tract infection.  Before using canned cat food with soupy gravy, I had to put water in their food.  Now I just give the cats their food out of the can with a few drops of high quality olive oil on top.  My male cat even goes into the trash bag to lick the can and lid.  I don't provide any dry food now because of my male cat's tendency to UTI.",5,1
"I've always been a fan of popcorn as a healthy (relatively) snack that at least offers a modicum of fiber, not too heavy calories and that is more or less good for your body if you can handle the sodium. Unfortunately, reduced portion packs of popcorn rarely satisfy, while reduced calorie popcorn tastes like cardboard, and whole bags of popcorn have just too many calories for a diet conscious body to consume. Then there's the 100-calorie ""snack packs' of various other things like crackers, cookies and chocolate that just as you start to get sated, the pack goes empty and you struggle with whether you should open another pack or just suffer through your hunger pangs. SnackWell's, on the other hand, offers this rich caramel coating with luscious fudge accent over crispy popcorn that comes in individual 130-calorie servings. The rich flavor, satisfying crunch with varied textures of stickiness, crispiness and chewiness makes it feel as though you are eating something substantial, while the extra 30 calories over the usual 100 leaves one feeling satisfied and not craving another pack. The mix of saltiness with caramel and sweet chocolate is just right. The 130 calorie packs are convenient and not diet breakers. And that's it. SnackWell's tastes great, helps in controlling calorie intake, and dispenses with hunger. It is highly likely this snack will become a regular in my diet.",5,1
"I tried to cancel shortly after ordering this product to find that it had already shipped.  After receiving it the packaging was simply a plain manilla envelope and a box, no lining, no bubble packing.  One pop was completely broken off of the stick, there are several others with chips and chunks broken off floating around loosely in the individual package.  If I use them they will have to be opened and removed from the individual package.  I am not happy with any aspect of this order.  I won't be ordering again.  I paid for 12 expecting to use 12, unfortunately that won't be the case.",1,0
These have been my favorite for years. There has not been a day without a jar of Candy-Krisp Jalapenos in my refrigerator since I first discovered them. They make my burgers taste so much better and everybody asks what these are after tasting them. I am glad that amazon carries these now.,5,1
Thses cooffee pods are extra nice because there is much less plastic and work just as well.  The flovor is nice and bold without being bitter.  I have re-ordered and will continue to do so.,5,1
"Got my first order today and couldnt wait to try it. I tried the choc mint cookie first and im so in heaven. I am excited to try the other flavors!!! I Just had a baby and im very health crazy, I always have been. This gives me the treat that I need, but still stay on track :) Two words to describe this ??? LOVE IT!! :) Thank you for the order, shipped fast arrived packed perfect.",5,1
"Partly my fault, I thought this was NORMAL muffin mix but was wheat or something.  Cannot find the original muffin mix in the store. So when I saw this one I thought it was what I was wanting.  So, partially my fault but it does not say wheat until you read further, it should be a part of the main description.",1,0
"It's not total crap, just a rip-off; it's ok with lots of cream and sugar, but at 18$/lb (w/ S&H), it is no better than Dunkin Donuts at the store. Will not buy again, needless to say.",1,0
"I love cookies and chocolate, but these are gross. They taste to me like chemicals and sugar, and the fudge gooey-ness just means more chemical in my mouth. Ugh.",1,0
"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG",5,1
"This is the second best bar I've ever had, just after Labrada's Cinnamon Bun Cookie Roll. Perfect for hiking as it stays soft and delicious when it's cold out and doesn't melt in the sun. Love these things.",5,1
"This Dark Magic, Extra Bold, Dark Roast is one of my favorites!  Great for that eye-opening first cup in the morning!  Then, for my second cup, I switch to the Green Mountain Haff-Caff.  Both have the deep flavor I crave!",5,1
We love these!!  I am back for a second order.  Great when you are looking for chocolate and salt at the same time!!,5,1
"Buying Canidae thru Amazon is truly one of today's best bargains.  Plus, Mr. UPS carries the 30 pound bag up my stairs!",5,1
"The best advice I can give is to try before you buy.  Get a small package from a grocery store so you won't have an entire case of something that's hard to palate.<br /><br />The concept sounded awesome - a crunchy snack made from just plain cheese and spices.  The execution, however, is lacking.<br /><br />These are DRY. Perhaps it's the lack of moisture, or maybe it's the salt - but these make you thirsty fast.  There is not much barbeque flavor to them - and it seems a bit off from standard BBQ.<br /><br />Now I'm just hoping to find one of my friends or family members to take 11 more packages off my hands so they don't have to be thrown out.",1,0
I had to cut back on my salt intake several years back and I was concerned that I would not be able to find a flavorful Bouillon.  I sure was wrong.  This is a very good flavored bouillon.  I would highly recommend it.,5,1
"And, these ones are just plain old pretty.<br /><br />I'd buy them more often if I needed that much candy at home. Alas, they're something special for when kids are on the calendar to visit.",4,1
"When we got this coffee my wife promptly told me she would make if for us the following morning.  She did, and it was one of the best tasting cups of coffee I had ever tasted.  I'm not a coffee addict or a person who would be able to notice much of a difference between a good Starbucks coffee and a cup of Maxwell House, but I certainly noticed how wonderful this coffee was. Great aroma and a full, rich taste!!!  The following morning I was looking forward to another cup of this coffee..... the first thing I notcied was the aroma was different.  Then, as I tasted the coffee I immediately told my wife it didn't taste the same a the previous day.  It was then that she admitted to me that the Marley coffee was too good to waste on my unappreciative taste buds.  She was keeping it for herself.  This coffee is very good.  I'll be buying some more of this just for me and I obviously recommend it.",5,1
"Wow! This is a perfect product to upset Michelle Obama: it keeps forever, tastes like dessert, and is good for you.  Might even make you fat, Michelle, which is a great American feature.",5,1
"This is basically a peppermint candy shaped like a sea shell.  It is milder than american peppermint, but not by much.  4 stars instead of 5 because this is not exotic.  It is fine, but nothing special except the bag I am going to frame.",4,1
"I got my 2 kittens about a year ago (June 08) and started them on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFEMHK"">Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Dry Cat Food (15.4-lb bag)</a>. They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE. But I decided to give Wellness Core a try now that they are older because EVO has a higher fat content and more calories and I didn't think they would need as much fat content now that they are about a year old.<br /><br />They seemed to like the taste of CORE just as much (maybe even a little more), but I will say that CORE has a much stronger, fishier smell than EVO. Also, a 12lb. bag of CORE is about the same price as a 15.4lb. bag of EVO, so CORE winds up being more expensive. Though it is more convenient to just go to PetCo to buy the CORE than it is to go to the specialty feed store to buy EVO.<br /><br />Bottom line: both are excellent dry cat foods, and I will probably wind up rotating between them. Since they are outdoor cats, I plan on feeding them EVO as the weather gets colder so they can build up a layer of fat for the winter, and Core when it's warmer and they don't need as much insulation.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/21/2012): One of our cats started having urinary tract problems. After doing some research online, I found a number of people using this cat food that have complained about urinary problems caused by this food. We have since switched to a different brand (Orijen) and the urinary crystals have gone away.",1,0
Just the right amount of heat and sweet for a low calorie treat. I'll be back for more once my supply runs out.,5,1

"Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed.",5,1
"My three year old Scottie has been fighting allergies since before his first birthday. Rx strength shampoos, topical and injected cortisone, and antihistamines, nothing seemed to bring him relief. During a vet recommended visit to an allergy specialist one of the vet techs suggested I try an elimination diet with a grain free food to rule out food allergies. I spent several weeks searching and discovered the FirstMate website. What did I have to lose? My pup was miserable. I ordered a 14.5 pound bag of Pacific Ocean Fish and after easing into a full change of diet, I threw away any foods/treats that contained grains. Taste, texture and smell seem to delight Duffy and he crunches his dinners with delight. Within two months the scratching, rubbing and licking had all but ended. We still have the occasional seasonal pollen/spore flare up, but these are easily controlled with medicated shampoo. Duffy's coat is shiny, he is happy and healthy and best of all he can take a walk without timeout for scratching.",5,1
"Where does this milk powder come from?  Bob's Red Mill grinds flour in the Northwest but many of their products are ""packaged"" at their location but are not made there.<br /><br />This buttermilk powder did nothing for me.  It didn't make a better biscuit or waffle and it made my loaf bread less tasty than if I had used regular milk powder.  This wasn't a successful product for me and I still have not finished the first package.  I won't restock it when/if I run out of it.",2,0
These cookies are terrific. Fresh and moist. Not hard like many store bought cookies. They are almost like moist little cakes. The individual packaging makes them a cinch to pack in a hurry and solves the problem of trying to keep the rest fresh.,5,1
"When you have a craving for a sweet but you don't won't too much, this bar is just perfect.  It's yummy.",5,1
"THIS IS FINE SOUP-TASTY,YOU MAY WANT TO ADD SALT,BUT IT TASTES PERFECT TO ME<br />THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT,LIKE IN ALL OR MOST CANNED FOODS, THE CANS ARE LINED WITH BPA SEE<br />[...]<br />NOT SO HEALTHY FOR AN 'ORGANIC' PRODUCT<br />A QUICK EASY, FULFILLING  MEAL WITH TOAST OR SANDWICHES, OR ALONE<br />I WILL BUY AGAIN<br />BTW- PACKED VERY WELL(TOO WELL), CAME WITH NO DAMAGE",5,1
I get these for my son and he was not big on them at first. So I added some pumpkin and that made the difference! I prepare them with almond milk and cook in coconut oil and they are now a staple!,5,1
these are delicious - just the right cinnamon/sugar blend; these are more flavorful than other Stacy's Pita flavors,4,1
"The plant in the picture looks so much greener and healthier than what I received in the mail today.  The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the ""waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it.",2,0
I've never tasted such good Brazil nuts in my life -- very fresh and tasty. I had to force myself to put them away before I ate a whole bag in one sitting. Very delicious.  I don't know what else to say.,5,1
"We actually found one of these at a bargain store today for $8 and it was worth the money - the batteries are already dying (likely because of kids playing with it in the store) but the sound and lights are true to advertisement - the Death Star lights up and plays the Star Wars theme when opened. It's a big dispenser and pops out the entire pack of pez, not single candies. Great for a Star Wars fan who has everything else, or a Pez Dispenser collector. :)",4,1

"I've been a loyal Real Salt user since 1995, and I've converted countless friends to it. I don't prepare meals without it, and I never leave home without it. That's right, I have a travel-size Real Salt with me at all times, whether in my coat pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  Once you taste it, you never want to deal with refined table salts or refined sea salts ever again. Compared to Real Salt, they taste so harsh and bitter. Food simply tastes better with this product.",5,1
"They've changed the description since I first purchased Mio.  I'm not sure I would have purchased ""sweet tea"".  The flavors I ordered were some kind of berry (purple) and strawberry (red).  I had been spending a fortune on the new Vitamin Waters and was thrilled to get virtually the same product that I could use with my own water.  Less expensive, fewer trips to the store and no having to drag cases of bottles home.  The strawberry wasn't the best, but the purple is great!  Delicious.",5,1
Took very little of the colored gel to produce vibrant colors until the old standby dropper liquid food dyes that take the whole bottle and barely give the hue one needs for dying foods. I will definitely be buying this product again.,5,1
"These are excellent beans and no funky chemicals added to retain color and texture.<br /><br />Canellini beans from Mangia Carmelina are bar none the best I've tried and you can make a simple meal for one with one can of beans, a scoop of Korean soybean paste and some Sriracha sauce heated up on the stove or in the microwave for a few minutes. So hearty and satisfying.<br /><br />I can't wait to try these in some Italian dishes too!<br /><br />Regarding shipping: I only got one slightly dented can in the bunch which I was able to open and use with no problem.<br /><br />A+++",5,1
"This is a lot of Fenugreek. We got it to make fenugreek compresses, which help reduce swelling and promote healing",5,1

I have acid reflux so this is the next best thing to fresh orange juice.  It says it has caffeine in it but no where on the label does it say that.  Who knows!  I used to get the big cans from Costco but they no longer carry it so thank you amazon!  Tang is great in 7up too!,5,1
"I'm very satisfy with this product, great tasting dry coconut.  I'm Brazilian and use this to make ""brigadeiros""  coconut truffles and works perfect.<br /><br />Already recommend to other friends.",5,1
These are very good bars and being individually wrapped stay fresh a long time. My husband carries them in his car for a quick and easy snack.,5,1
I knew something was wrong when I opened the bag.  The beans had no shine or smell.  The coffee is worst than any off the shelf store brand and cost more.  I thought I could never taste a bad coffee until I bought this and now I have three bags! grrrr,1,0
"This is by far my favourite sauce from this company. Don't be turned off by the fact that it uses habanero peppers - I would say it is at best a ""medium"" sauce. The flavour is outstanding though - I use it on everything from tuna salad to spicing up pico. Excellent product.",4,1
"This shortbread is a little less moist than I like, but the taste is good. There is no artifical sugar aftertaste. They are a reasonable substitute for those with such diet restrictions.",4,1
"I LOVE these canned cannellini beans. They are organic, which is important to me, and do not contain any of the harmful chemicals/preservatives that so many canned products have. I also love the fact that there is no salt added, another hard to find quality in canned goods.<br /><br />While I do prefer to make my own beans from scratch, when in a pinch, these serve me well. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the product or experienced the problems that a couple of the other reviewers have had. The beans always come out creamy and delicious...they are good enough to eat on salads (after a rinse of course).<br /><br />The Subscribe & Save option is great for these, too, because it works out to be less than what I would pay in my local grocery store for the same product. Plus, buying products by the case is not only easier, but it leads to a well-stocked pantry. I will always keep these beans on hand.<br /><br />I love Eden Organic products, but this is definitely my favorite!",5,1
This is a shampoo I feel good about using every day.  Sometimes even more than once a day depending on my activities.  I feel like it really keeps my hair and scalp moisturized and that it is actually making my hair healthier.  It lathers up really well with just using a small amount and it rinses out great.  It smells clean and fresh.  I love it.,5,1
"I had heard about the wonders of coconut oil not only for cooking but also as body lotion, conditioner, hair gel, and intimate lube. I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and love it! It has a nice, mild coconut smell and works very well for all of the above, though I haven't cooked with it yet. It's solid at room temperature, but melts when you warm it in your hands. I'm glad to use this instead of other products with artificially manufactured chemicals and preservatives in them. I'm very satisfied and plan to use this long term.",5,1
"I''m so glad we took a chance and bought Greenies after reading really good reviews. Our cat knows when its time for her treats. Shes always been a mild manner little sweetheart but when she hears the bag open she turns into a sweet pushy cat.

"50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results",4,1
"I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler.

"I tried this product out of the blue because I live in Japan and am not able to `shop around`.  I basically hit gold on my first try.  The consistency of this pasta is suprisingly good, and really, it is NOT MUSHY.  Follow the instructions i.e cook for 16 minutes then rinse under the tap.  It comes out perfect every time.  It doesnt have a particular strong taste therefore kids wont be able to tell the difference, I couldn`t either.  For those who need to avoid wheat this is a perfect substitute.  This product comes in a pack of pack of 12, so please bear this in mind when you place your order.",5,1
"I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!",5,1

"They have a sweet and ever so slightly tart, cherry vanilla flavor. I really like the flavor, I just wish it were a tiny bit stronger.  I leave them in a jar for my kids to enjoy, especially after snacks and meals.  Guilt-free and good for your teeth.  All in all, a great lollipop with pretty, swirly colors too.",5,1

Not only coffee, but other items as well.<br />Books, a very large selection, something for everyone.

"I'm the only coffee drinker in my household, so I really like the convenience of these single serve pods. They've got a great flavor (I really liked a little bit of vanilla creamer in mine). They make clean-up a breeze - just toss the used pod into the trash or compost bin when you're done. Since they are individually packaged, they stay nice and fresh (and I don't have to worry about my two-year-old pouring a new bag of coffee out on the floor. I enjoyed the flavor and the convenience.

"They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping.

"Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",5,1

"Received my Brazil nuts yesterday and I'm happy to say I'm really satisfied.<br />The added incentive to buying these nuts on Amazon is that I was unable to buy them from W-mart, they were unavailable for what seemed like months and I didn't feel like waiting any longer.<br />One reason for eating Brazil nuts is their high amounts of selenium plus they taste so good. Since I log my food intake on fitday.com it's comforting to see that only one Brazil nut to gets you the RDA of this important nutrient but not too much from mega dose vitamins.  I would rather get my nutrients from natural sources if possible rather than from supplements.<br /> One problem, trying to eat only one maybe two nuts takes some will power.<br />I'll be ordering again, that's for sure. The price was right and the shipping was fast.<br />One last note; I always store nuts in the fridge so they say fresher.",5,1
Love this pasta - just bought 2 cases of it - that's 24 one lb bags. Don't want to ever run out of it. Cooking it is easier than regular pasta and much much much better than the DeBole brand. You won't go wrong by trying Tinkyada pasta products.,5,1

My boyfriend who I made it with liked the taste a little bit, so I'm sure some people will like it and others will not. The little eggs that you make taste pretty okay. It's worth it just to go through the process of making the sushi. I would definitely recommend for an hour of fun or so!",4,1

"I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also.",5,1

"Haven't gotten a box of yogi tea I didn't like and this one is no different. It's more of an herbal infusion with green tea, so it might not be as ""tea-y"" as one might expect. But if you're unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff, I'd buy a box at the store and test it out, because a case is a huge price savings in my CT area of about about $1.50 a box, but it's an expensive loss if it turns out you don't like it. Hopeful for good results! I'm getting married in four months and am using this as a part of a healthier skin routine.",4,1

Light, refreshing, not sweet, no aftertaste and I like the Black Raspberry, Lemon-Lime,  Grapefruit, and Orange Mango.  Added bonus - no calories. I love the carbonation.  As with any carbonated drink, I take caution in opening; so far no problem.  They are a little pricey in the grocery store at .99 each, but BJ's have them for $9.99 a case which includes the variety above (except for Grapefruit).",5,1

"This box looks impressive, but it's very misleading. Items are really small.

The box was filled with LOTS of styrofoam peanuts and a little crinkled colored paper. For $39.99 on sale, it wasn't the really nice gift package I thought I was buying.",2,0
Great tasting granola bar that makes a nice snack.  It's my new favorite.  I have not been able to find these in stores.,5,1
"I purchased a tin of Get Gorgeous tea at a local shop because I'm trying to improve my overall health.  I should note that I'm also taking a multivitamin, a hair/skin/nails vitamin, and flax seed oil capsules (all vegan) once a day, so if I see improvement in the condition and clarity of my skin, it's as likely as not that both resulted from the many changes I'm making to my diet and lifestyle choices as from this tea.<br /><br />However this is still a really delicious, soothing blend of rooibos, chamomile, orange peel, and several other herbal ingredients.  I'm not big on fruity teas, but Get Gorgeous has just enough fruity flavor to keep a drinker from needing to add sugar.  The dominant flavor is definitely a soothing herbal one.<br /><br />Since I live in the South, where sweet tea rules all, I would recommend this to anybody who wants to give up sugar-sweetened tea without sacrificing a familiar flavor.  I've never liked sweet tea, but I have tasted it, and Get Gorgeous has a similar (though not nearly as strong) sweet taste that I think would go over well with health-conscious Southerners.",4,1

"I got my bag from Costco and it was really good. I'm not sure how Amazon's version is but the coffee I got was very smooth and not at all acidic or sour as others complained. The batch must have been really fresh since the glass container I put it in would pop every time I opened it. When I roast coffee, this will occur from the gasses being released and expanding. Again, I got mine from Costco and from my guess, they take orders and have them filled directly from the company, so it was pretty fresh. The price was very decent for organic fair trade as well. Even for espressos, latte's and cap's, it's a very nice coffee. Highly recommend. Suggestion, don't over grind or drink after coffee has been sitting too long, it will get sour and/or bitter. Don't buy coffee that's been sitting on shelves too long either.<br /><br />Oh yeah, DON'T EVER BUY COFFEE FROM TJMAXX, MARSHALL'S, ROSS, OR HOME GOODS (I know, they're basically the same store). Every time I've bought a food item from these companies it was horrid!! A batch of coffee I got from TJMaxx turned to dust when I tried to grind it!? They wouldn't take it back either. Even the clothes are irregular, but food items, forgettabboutit.",5,1
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1,0

The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!

"I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good.",4,1

Overall I would buy this again (and I have!)<br /><br />For the price?  Excellent!",5,1
"This popcorn makes for a very tasty snack!  The popcorn is generously covered in caramel and drizzled in chocolate.  It's a tasty sweet treat.  The individual packs are handy for lunches, and convenient because they keep you from eating the whole box (you'll want to).  This didn't taste like a diet or low-fat food.  There were no weird flavors or strange aftertastes.  I would definitely buy this; I'm hoping that there are more flavors.",5,1

"I am soooo glad they have amazon in the age of gluten free mania. People who dont even have celiac disease are avoiding gluten and making this awesome meat substitute ingredient scarce! THANKS amazon! I made some wheat meat with this mix and it was great! Why spend tons of cash on gimme lean when you can make it at home? The answer is NO REASON! If anyone is curious look up wheat meat online, you can boil gluten and then you have a quality meat substitute! SOOOO cool. I am not always a vegetarian, but it IS healthier- I am about 90% veg these days and gluten has saved the day. It is healthier for my body and the environment- and thanks to amazon I can make wheat meat! yay! PLEASE dont stop selling this! These boxes are just right, they are an affordable starter pack for making your own wheat meat. You can add about a cup of water and your own seasonings per package and you knead it into a very very dense ball.It is great when it is really dense. You can twist it and make it into more of an oval. Boil for approx 2 hours, cool. Once it sets you can get an idea of what you are working with, it is a lot like many other meat substitutes. So cool. (UPDATE: I tried adding TVP, dont do it! Hah ha... Herbs are one thing, but your TVP will fall out, its a mess. Unless you want it to -which it is actually kinda cool because it makes the wheat meat hold sauces easilly... If that is what you want, little holes from falen TVP -go right ahead. Its a cooking tactic I suppose!)----I am so excited! Try adding marinades in the place of water. However much you use it should be dense (very) yet still pliable. After a test run on the first box you will be able to see how you would like your own texture. It does take about 1.5 to 2 hours to cook, so batch cooking is a must. After it is completely cooked you can refrigerate and it seems even better after it has been cold. It browns very fast after it has been refrigerated. Re-cooking in various forms is so fun! Stir frys, anything. Buying more gluten, may end up with this brand again because it is so afforadable.",5,1
"Both of our cats love this!<br /><br />I have paid special attention to the ingredients list and have been pleased to find that it does not include corn products or byproducts.  Sadly, most cat foods on the market have corn as their first, second, or third ingredient.  Sometimes it is both the second AND third ingredient (corn meal and another corn byproduct, etc.).  I wish I had known this fact a long time ago.  I have recently been looking for a healthier choice for my two cats and even the ones that state that they are a healthy alternative tend to contain ingredients that I would question and in amounts that are alarming.  This is the ONLY cat food at my market that does not contain corn as a main ingredient and it seems the healthiest alternative.  I have tried (through Amazon) other alternatives that are just as healthy, but sadly my cats did not like the taste.  This one they adore.<br /><br />Healthy and tasty.  I couldn't ask for more.",5,1

"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in pât&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.",5,1
great product..my dogs love them more than any...quick response to my order. thanks to K9 Power for providing such an amazing product,5,1

"My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.",5,1
"I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms. Does much better with this food than others. He is a very picky eater, so I do add chicken and he will eat. We will stick with Harmony Farms. I also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh.",5,1

"I order a package of 12 Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, which by the way is an excellent chocolate, but when it arrived the bars were bent and melting due to he heat of the delivery truck. I contacted the seller and without questions or argument I was sent another order. I received the order well packed and cold in 2 days. Because I was stunned to see such customer service I contacted the seller once again to offer payment for the UPS cost, but the seller refused stating that their goal is total satisfaction and that I should not pay for the shipping. Just amazing service! I will recommend this seller to anyone and ask to support them. If there were more stars to give I would had given them the max.<br />I hope this review helps.<br />DF",5,1
I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.,2,0

"The package came perfectly on time.  I ordered two packages of 50 green mountain k cups but after I tried several cups they all taste old like if I was sent something that was sitting in storage for a while. This old taste was evident from both packages.  I drink green mountain at work so I know what the coffee should taste like.  DOnt buy from this seller, it looks like they send you old products that have been on the shelf for to long.",2,0
"I knew I would love these things. they are so cute, fit easily into a purse or lunchbox and they are quite filling (as as snack) despite the thin granola. I would agree that the chocolate is most certainly not dark---more like milk and if it gets warm (in your hometown) you should pop them in the fridge before you head out. I noticed that a few of my portable ones melted. But it was no biggie and I really enjoyed them. The item arrived on time and I will certainly order them again.",4,1

"I loved the Blueberry Pomegranate flavor enough to be getting regular deliveries.  But this month  Blackberry Pomegranate shows up without any notice to me.  I do not care for this flavor as much as the Blueberry combination and am most annoyed that no one gave me any advance notice that my regular order was being changed.  Amazon, this is a glitch you need to fix!!  The seller should advise the buyer that they are no longer getting the product they wanted!<br />As for the merits of the drink:  it is okay but too strong on the Blackberry side.  Unless you really like the taste of blackberry that much you probably won't love this one.  I've cancelled this subscription!",2,0

"I am super picky about tea. I am forever disappointed that restaurants and cafes, even high end ones, have such crappy tea bags. This Assam is far and away the best one that is currently on the market in bags. It is rich, smooth and bold all at the same time. I do not leave home without these tea bags in my purse. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the packaging. Yes, they are individually wrapped, however I much prefer them this way. This tea is delicious. As usual, Amazon has the very best price.",5,1
I LOVE this product.  I would do without food before I would do without this.  The benefits are multiple - it helps keep you regular and also helps take the stress and tension out of your muscles.  It does take 4-6 weeks to notice full change in your muscles.  I certainly don't feel the stress in my upper back the way I use to - and I still do the same type of computer work day in and day out.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  You won't regret it - and Amazon has the best price of anywhere I've found it so far.,5,1
"I've been doing the Dukan low carb diet, and these are the best snack I've found so far. They're lean, tasty, and good for you. If you're trying to do a low carb diet, or even just snacking healthier, these are a great addition to the pantry.",4,1
These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.,5,1

My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.

"This is actually the only protein drink I've tried.  My diet is sorely lacking in protein, and I thought this would be a perfect way to get more... especially since I love iced coffee.  The taste is fabulous, the vitamin & mineral count is good.  After a month of having Click for breakfast, I can really feel a difference in the way my body is functioning.  I would recommend Click to anyone who needs more protein in their diet, and is not worried about the caffeine.",5,1

"I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?",5,1

"I have tried a variety of high UMF honey brands, and this is the best tasting, most effective brand I've tried, and nowadays, Wedderspoon's 16 is the only stuff I buy.<br /><br />Think about it. If you're using Manuka honey to treat various gastrointestinal troubles (we use it any time we suspect food poisoning, intestinal virus, heartburn, reflux, ulcer, etc.... and there is NOTHING better!) then why would you use anything other than organic? Seriously. Any time your stomach just doesn't feel right, dip a teaspoon (a regular silverware-type, not a measuring teaspoon) half way into your honey (no need to ""scoop"", just dip), and eat it. You will feel relief so quickly you will NEVER reach for a Rolaid again. This has worked wonderfully on all 3 of my children as well.<br /><br />I only buy my Wedder's from Amazon, (not Marketplace) and I take advantage of the Super Saving Shipping. (Late in the season it can be hard to find, so I've learned to stock up for the year.) Remember: New Zealand seasons are the opposite of ours, and honey is not harvested in the winter/spring). So if you live in the US, and you're using Manuka honey, it may get a little tough to find during our summer/fall, since that is the New Zealand winter/spring.<br /><br />I have NEVER had any trouble with the way the honey's been shipped. It's always been taped, bubble packed, etc., and never has any of it shown any signs of leakage. Even so, buying from Amazon, the possibility of leakage has never been a worry, because in my experience, Amazon stands behind what it sells. Who else does that?  :o)",5,1

"And the sailor said 'Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be..."" Okay, so, that song is the only real reference to brandy I have, and that's not even the right brandy. Well, that song and the singer from the 90s...anyway. In college, one of my roommates liked to mix (cheap, horrible) brandy with her cola when she drank, and so I've had a few of those, but that's really it. I'm a whisky girl, through and through. That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought ""why not?"" If nothing else, it will be good for mixing with the apple matcha. Or the cola matcha, for when I'm having a bad day at work and need a drink but can't have one just yet. At least I can pretend. But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares. With this, I'm just shooting in the dark, though I'm sure I'll be comparing it to whisky before this review is done.<br /><br />Oh wow, this is good. This is goooood. Yes, the unnecessary ""o""s were necessary. It's fruity and smooth and...yum. I don't quite know how to describe it. It's not what I was expecting out of brandy, but I don't really have any experience with brandy, so what do I know? I can almost taste a touch of alcohol, but that might just be my imagination. It does seem warming, which is odd since I'm drinking it cold. I love cold matcha and how easy it is to mix. Add water to matcha powder, whisk/froth, and go! Done! Yum. Saves me a ton of time in the mornings when I'm barely awake and trying to get ready for work.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. If this is what brandy tastes like, I need to try some as soon as possible. I think my father in law has some...it might be time to hang out with the in laws. It tastes kind of like bubble gum but...juicy fruit gum, not double bubble. Definitely one I plan to keep around.",5,1
"Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.  After my own research, I found that an anti-inflammatory diet could help.  Matcha Green Tea was mentioned by several sources. Red Tea Leaf teas are excellent and their customer service is fast and friendly.  I had tried several different brands, but Red Tea Leaf's variety of favors that they mix with the Matcha was what drew me to this company.<br /><br />I chose Espresso Matcha because I am a coffee drinker, but wanted to drink several glasses of Matcha Green Tea a day and knew I would have to forgo my coffee to drink this much (and I love coffee).  There is a subtle flavor of espresso mixed with the Matcha green tea.<br /><br />During a workout when a bar bell completely slipped out of my hand because I lost my grip, I decided I had to try something.  I stopped drinking coffee `cold turkey' as soon as my Espresso Matcha from Red Tea Leaf order arrived and never once got a headache.<br /><br />My favorite summer time way to drink this tea is to mix 1 heaping scoop of Matcha green tea into my 20 oz. water bottle the night before, then refrigerate so I `m ready to go in the morning (I make 3 of these each night when I `m packing my lunch).  Just make sure to shake it before you drink it, the Matcha tea settles to the bottom.  Within two weeks, the ache-y feeling in my hands every morning almost completely disappeared!  I am able to grip jars to open them without pain.  During my workouts, I focus completely on form and only later realize, I never thought once about my hands!  They do not hurt... at all!<br /><br />As for my diet, I ate very `clean' before I started drinking Matcha tea from Red Tea Leaf and I love scientific research (I know, nerdy), so drinking 3 heaping scoops of Matcha tea a day was the only change that I made.  I consistently drink 60-80 oz of water now, but even before when I tried drinking this much water to flush out my system my hands still hurt.  It was not until I added the Match green tea from Red Tea leaf that I noticed an improvement in my hand.<br /><br />I am so happy with this product!  Thank you Red Tea Leaf!",5,1

My dog has yet to hesitate when I serve her food with the Glucosamine oil.  She is a very active dog and I hope to keep her as healthy and happy as possible for her entire life.

"My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q"">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends and don't expect too much.",2,0
"The winter here in Afghanistan has been colder than anyone can remember and it has snowed here more than it has ever snowed in the last 10 years.  One thing that helps keep my bones toasty is this fine quality hot chocolate.  I first got turned on to this brand when I took a free sample from a care package at the local Red Cross on post.  From the first cup I was hooked.  This is the best tasting instant hot cocoa I ever had...ever!  After this, I can no longer go back to the less expensive products.  Every sip of this cocoa is like being on top of mount Everest with the cold brisk wind flowing through your hair but at the same time a warm fuzzy sensation is circulating throughout your body keeping you warm from the hard mountain top conditions.  Yes!  It's that good!  Try it for yourself.",5,1
This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.  I guess I will have to go back to plain iced tea because I threw this stuff out.

Actually picked this up from Whole Foods.  Appears to have leaked a bit on the way home (20 minutes) enough to make the bottle sticky and also the rest of the items in the bag.

I was happy when I heard that Chatfield's Carob Chips were now NOT made with icky barley malt, and were dairy free. They aren't available anywhere in my area, so I ordered in bulk from Amazon. When they arrived, I ripped open a bag- and found them so sickeningly sweet I could hardly eat them. They honestly taste more like white chocolate than carob.

"I have a feeling this is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for adults.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to buy one of these at a local store several months ago and my mouth still waters whenever I think of them.<br /><br />I used to LOVE the regular Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but the last few times I've splurged calories on them, I've been less than thrilled. They seem so small and wimpy! Did they really get smaller or is my mouth that much bigger? I can eat a whole regular-sized cup in one bite, and it mostly tastes of the (as another poster unkindly pointed out) slightly waxy chocolate. To me, Reese's Cups have always been about the peanut butter filling, but it seems lacking to me now in the regular-sized cups.<br /><br />Enter the Big Cup! Naturally, it's bigger, but it also seems to have more peanut butter inside--which means more of that yummy peanut flavor. Even though you only get one per pack, and one Big Cup weighs less than two regular-sized cups, I still found it far more *satisfying* than the two-pack. I was able to eat it the way I like--nibble the edges and then chomp the peanutty middle--and the peanut butter flavor filled my mouth to perfection. Mmmmm!<br /><br />I'll keep my eyes open for these at the local stores, since it's already too hot where I live to order chocolate by mail. Otherwise, come Fall, I guess I'll order a box or two if they're still available. *hope!* If you see this at the store, and you're a Reese's Cup fan from way back, grab it, you lucky dog!",5,1
"I heard about this salt on a forum a while back. Many people said it was the real thing. So I ordered it from Amazon. It was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy. I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta. The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing. I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer. That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt and MSG...  I found the peppered bacon salt no better than the natural flavor.  Just add some pepper to your food..  it is better than this",2,0

I would like it to be a little less expensive so I could enjoy using it even more, like on oatmeal,in my coffee and other luxuries, but then it really is worth the price.",5,1
"I can't say I'm very impressed with this product. First of all, something is wrong with the lid, which prevents it from closing all the way. The bottle arrived in a plastic bag and about 20% of the bottle's content spilled into the plastic bag on the way. The bottle ended up looking messy and being slippery to the touch. I had to wash it before using it and it was dripping all over the place. My husband has almost finished the bottle by now but we still haven't found a way to get it to close all the way.<br /><br />The shampoo and conditioner are not bad but they do nothing to eliminate dandruff. It's a little annoying to see the words ""anti-dandruff"" on a product which doesn't even remotely begin to do anything to fight dandruff.

I ordered this product for my father {he's 92}. He cannot have calcium. This is a great product that also taste good. The fact that you can store it in the cabinet until ready to use is a plus.,5,1
I ordered these jordon almonds hoping I could get a good product using Amazon Prime. These are not good at all. they have a very hard thick coating that could easily break a tooth. The coating taste like hard sugar and you can not taste the almond at all. Very disappointed. Sorry.,1,0
"The box I got says good until march 2013.<br /><br />This is the best brand mustard out there, the sweet mustard is one of their best flavors, good for making many things not just on sandwiches or corn dogs.",5,1
"I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!",5,1
Great mustard I bought it as a gift for someone who really liked it but couldn't find it in stores. I am getting ready to order more as the ones we kept for ourselves are almost gone. I would highly recommend tbis product,5,1
"I am currently living in Hungary and I have yet to find Italian dressing in a store. There may be specialty stores that import it, but then it would cost an arm and a leg. Shipping stuff here from the US is also prohibitively expensive and so mix packets are the best way to go. When I have friends coming out, they can pack it in a suit case without killing their weight allowance.<br /><br />The family loves it and I enjoy having a little control over exactly how the dressing will taste by being able to make changes in type of vinegar. It's very good and the whole family likes it.",5,1
"I recently started a new medication and unfortunately one of the side effects was dry mouth. My doctor recommended I try sugar free lemon drops to help alleviate the discomfort of dry mouth. After doing some research I decided to give Brach's Sugar Free Lemon Drops a try. I was a bit hesitant ordering a whole box of these lemon drops without knowing how they would taste, what the after-taste would be like and even if it would work. After having used them for couple of weeks, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. I keep a bag in mine and my wife's car, one at work, in my night stand drawer and in a candy dish in the kitchen. My wife usually hates the taste of most sugar-free products because of the after-taste, but I was surprised when she said she really liked these! Give these a try if you too suffer from dry mouth and see if they work as well for you as they have for me.",5,1

"My dogs gobbled the food up in no time, but honestly what animal will not eat a new kind of food that is placed in front of them that smells and looks like beef.  It even states in the ingredients that natural filet mignon flavor is used.  It looks appealing with dry kibble and some moist chunks. In the ingredients it states by- product poultry is used, but I like that fact that beef is the first ingredient listed which means it is he highest concentrated ingredient used.<br /><br />I had previously purchased the ridiculously highly priced ""organic"" dog food, but after a recent very large recall of a well known dog food brand that has many labels, I switch to Purina brands since they have NEVER had a recall of dog food.

However, for a 4.5 pound bag for a Purina brand dog food you can buy anywhere I think it is a tad bit expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding my poochies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FVTQJQ"">Purina Beneful Healthy Weight</a>, but I am going to mix things up and buy the large bag of Purina Beneful and a small bag of Chef Michael's and mix them up and feed them a smorgasbord every night.",4,1

My aunt kept telling us we HAD to try it, but we've been unable to find it in stores so far this year.  She liked it well enough to have me order a 6 pack here on Amazon, and even subscribe to having it delivered on a regular basis.  When it arrived, she shared some with us and I have to say it is quite delicious!  It does have somewhat an eggnog flavor, but to me it's almost more a mellow Chai flavor, lightly spiced, with vanilla.  Very good & something different, tea-wise.",4,1

"My son's teacher gave me a box of this tea as a holiday present 5 years ago.  Every holiday season I can't wait to find this tea on the shelves.

"I have a 10 month old Lab puppy, 50 pounds, and he is a big time chewer/shredder.  He's gotten to a point where he is only interested in a toy if it has a treat (Kong, IQ treat ball, etc) or can be shredded apart (stuffed animals, tennis balls, etc).  I was happy to see that this keeps him occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time and I only put one gnawhide treat on it at a time.  He usually chews the ends of the bones as well as tries to get the gnawhide off.  We have a Med/Lg size (seems to be the perfect size for him) and it takes him just a few minutes to get the actual gnawhide off when he is trying, the rest of the time is spent happily chewing on the ends.  My dog usually isn't interested in Nylabones so I was surprised to see him chewing on this so much.<br /><br />I will agree with a couple other reviews:<br />-  White nylon bone easily gets chewed up and gets quite sharp.  He hasn't had any cuts in his mouth that I've found, but I do have to be careful when unscrewing the ends because of how sharp it is.<br />-  It's quite heavy for a toy.  My dog loves to get playful and throw toys into the air with his mouth, but this one is a little too heavy for that, and so far he hasn't shows any interest in chewing on the ball in the center.<br /><br />One more downside for me is that the treats can get expensive.  So far they are at least $0.50 per gnawhide (they were about $0.80 each at Target) so if you were to use 2 treats at a time like it is meant for, that's at least a $1 a pop.  So I've resorted to using this as a special treat every couple of days instead of daily.<br /><br />Also, I asked a vet about the cornstarch ones and they said they highly DO NOT RECOMMEND CORNSTARCH for animals, that dogs can't digest them well, just as they say to avoid dog food that has corn.",4,1

"I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say ""wow what smells so delicious?"". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!",5,1

(None of his medication had been able to do that.)<br /><br />My 5 y.o. daughter didn't notice this in her oatmeal... I tried it, and there is no added taste, just health benefits :)<br /><br />Great product. We always have it at our house.",5,1
"I got hooked on Green Mountain Southern Pecan coffee when my husband and I lived in Maine. I stocked up on it when we moved back to the South and continued to order it in bulk until a couple of months ago when I got my Keurig. Brewing it one cup at a time is the next best thing to living in Maine and being able to go to just about any convenience store and take my pick of the flavors (I almost always chose Southern Pecan). I've ordered the K-cups from Amazon three times now and just placed my fourth order, the second with this company.

"For Over 15 years, Ive been using the Tahini that comes in a can. Always trying to scrape the hard stuff off the bottom, and mix in the oils from the top... This Tahini is SO Delicious.

"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!",4,1
"In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer.",5,1

"Of course that is subjective, but, for myself and my family, we all agree that the vanilla sandwich WhoNu cookies are the best of all their varieties.  We've tried them all and this is the only one that we get on a regular basis.  They taste the most like a normal cookie, with a pleasant sweet vanilla taste, but not sickeningly sweet like most store-bought cookies.  Plus they have the benefit of some added nutrients.  They are still a cookie, so you can't really eat a bunch of them anyway.  But I feel better eating these than say, an Oreo.  The other WhoNu cookies tend to taste like ""health cookies""...not all that great.  This one is the closest to a ""regular cookie"".",5,1
"OMG...I am in heaven! It has been so long since I have had these WONDERFUL treats. I looked but could only find sugar free. I have loved these since I was a little girl and NO other so called butterscotch would do, so I went without until now!!! :-) Thank so much!",5,1

"My dog LOVES these, especially the peanut butter ones.  He goes insane when i open the bag, and they are perfect for training. Id recommend cutting them in half for puppies, smaller dogs. they are already small, but it makes them easier to swallow and continue with rapid training. Dont listen to people about how bad they smell, sure they don;t smell like roses, but the smell is more than tolerable. The people say it is unbearable must have the most sensitive olfactory in the world. Just rinse your hands with water after, and the smell is gone. I prefer the smell of the peanut butter ones, and my dog loves them. gets reaaly excited, which is what i need when training him",5,1
"My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!",5,1
"Great product, price is very reasonable.  Only issue is if you add it to hot water, it tends to clump.

Switched to enfamil and will never go back!",5,1
"First:<br /><br />You can read and understand every ingredient in these Health Valley products! None of them would sound foreign to you.<br />They are all natural, and this is good for you.<br /><br />Second:<br /><br />It tastes wonderful! Many Americans (respectfully :-  are used to being fed overly salted, sugared, and processed foods, which<br />is why their palates are destroyed, and so they can't appreciate good flavor in natural occurring foods. If one stops eating<br />salt and sugar heavy foods, then within 2 - 3 weeks they'll start sensing the good flavor in natural organic products,... including<br />the excellent flavor of this Health Valley product series. =:)<br /><br />I hope this helps you.",5,1
"This is a great substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome. Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. I like mild best, and teriyaki is my second favorite. Both of these flavors are safe if you avoid spicy stuff like I do. If you like things hot, try some of the other flavors!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!",4,1

"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!",5,1

"Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's ""satisfying"" and ""nutritious.""  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.",5,1
"Finally ! THIS Japanese WAFU  Vinaigrette.  I bought this brand at the street festival in Washington DC during Cherry Blossom time a few years ago. Its was SO GOOD! Just a dab on your finger and your sold.  I bought 4  bottles and gave them as gifts, then I couldn't find it back home in Florida! My family loves this toasty sesame vinaigrette, good on mandarin orange salad, reheating  store bought Chinese food or  making home made Chinese food. I cant wait till my order gets here! I use the ""light"" but cant wait to try the rest.  Just shake well and  refrigerate after opening.  This is a definite foody MUST HAVE find :)",5,1
"I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!",5,1
"I recently started dragging myself out of bed at 5 am weekdays to exercise. Since I'm a night owl, this is no easy feat! After my workout, I need something to 'refuel' while getting ready for work. I eat only organic food and tried several types of organic breakfast bars but none gave me the boost I needed. My goal was to find something with a high protein content AND great taste AND no early-morning stomach upset. I found Orgain while searching amazon.com and after reading only a few of the 5 star reviews, I ordered the Creamy Chocolate Fudge.<br /><br />Well, this is IT. Orgain covers all the bases - organic, high protein, balanced nutrition, convenient, gentle on my stomach, and it tastes GREAT. I'm stocking up and will use it post-exercise and also to keep me energized during 50 mile endurance rides on my horse.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how wonderful Orgain is but writing this review has made my mouth water enough that I'm signing off to go have one!",5,1

"Teens love em, adults love em...somehow the little 5 year old doesn't like them though.  He's just a strange little one though.  These are really good!  Bag is light, which you'd expect for 100 calories, but it's still more than we expected for a 100 cal snack.  Seems like a good price too, compared with other snacks I've seen in the grocery store (haven't seen these  yet).<br /><br />EDIT: haha! the 5 year old caved, he likes them now too!",5,1
"If you're sensitive to sugar alcohols (the ones that produce an unfortunate laxative effect) beware of this product.

I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper.

"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.",4,1
"What would you like to know about salt? You can most likly learn all (...)On the morton [site] you can read up on all the different uses for salt, for cleaning, your feet, your throat and so on. Beyond that, I will add my opinion. Morton was a well trusted product long before I was born. When I was a kid they use to really promote the anti clumping agent in the salt, so it poured when it rained. From what little I know about geology, salt has in some cases been around for millions of years. But mineral deposits in some area are more pure then in other area. We know we can trust Morton to give us the cleanest, purest product available. Even when the company is bought and sold, they still seem to maintain their high standard of excellance. Everyone needs salt, but we should also be careful not to over due our salt intake.",5,1
"I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!",5,1
"Twinings Peach Black Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />Great service quick delivery",5,1
"This may be a tea that I will stick with - it's a whole leaf tea in a delicious India/China blend with an impressively complex and well-balanced flavor.<br /><br />Attractively and conveniently packaged, and shipped regularly in small amounts to ensure freshness (the Subscribe & Save option is a MUST.) I may have found what I have been looking for!",5,1
"This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!!",5,1
I have to say this is one of the best quality spice boxes I have ever seen. The steel is very heavy duty. The spices that come with it are beautifully packaged in a box for gift giving. I love the contemporary look of Ajika brand products!,5,1
I could no longer find this tea at the grocery stores so bought it in bulk. I love this chai tea. Has the right amount of spice and smooth to drink.,5,1
I used this in my families xmas grab bag.  It was a hit and was stolen several times during the course of the game.  If you have someone who was young in the 60s but not too young to remember this will make a great gift.,5,1
"Despite the recent negative reviews, I had no issues.  Cans were clean, no dents, package was in good shape.  Milk is good quality and the price is decent.",5,1
I like the size of the mini tootsie rolls. you don't feel guilty because it is only 10 cals each. i love the orange flavor the most.,5,1
"I love gingerbread and ginger cookies, and Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies are the best tasting ginger cookies I've found. When they are fresh they have a nice chewy texture and just the right bite of crystallized ginger. I spread them with peanut butter for a fast breakfast or quick snack: the flavors meld perfectly. My only quibble: they are rather pricey, and if they are not at their peak of freshness, they get hard, dry and brittle, though you can revive them somewhat by dunking them in milk or tea. In the store, you can tell the state of freshness by lightly pressing your thumb on the sample cookie through the cellophane. The cookie will yield slightly if it is fresh. If it doesn't yield at all, the cookies are stale: don't buy the box. I would give these cookies 5 stars if they were always sold fresh.",4,1
This is the tastiest granola I've ever tried. Not sure what else to say.  You should try it right away.,5,1
"It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.",4,1
"This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was ""mercury is less than 400 parts per billion"". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process.",1,0
Excellent bold coffee and I love that it is all contained in an environmentally friendly one box!,4,1
"i am a fan of the tassimo machine, and many of the t-discs.  however the signature blend should be retitled the signature bland.  perhaps i just look a fuller bodied coffee particularly in the morning, but this one was exceptionally disappointing to me... take note of the different roast levels posted on tassimos website before buying discs that cost about $.50-$.75 per cup...",1,0
I used to buy bottled tea but this makes a lot more sense. The bags come in 4's perfect for a large bodum teapot i have. I'm saving a lot of money over the store bought brew and I know what's in it!,5,1
"yes, this is flavored coffee already...but, it's a great base for some spiked refreshment.  i like Carolans or Baileys, but Saint Brendans works well too.  be sure you use a tall cup so you have room for the extra spirits. what could possibly go wrong with that! i'm signing up for a subscription with free shipping.",5,1
"When I received my box of cans, almost half were dented and the tops rounded up indicating that there was bacteria causing pressure.  I would not buy this product again.  Also, it tastes very bland.",1,0
I love this product but you have to be aware that it is fatally toxic to dogs.  Don't make cookies or something and let them get to it.<br /><br />This price looks especially great in this 5 lb pack--less than $5/pound.{plus shipping},5,1
"If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.  Also, it continues to be an easy way to get super foods into our toddlers without the preparation of the fruits and vegetables!  We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone.",4,1
"Shame on me for thinking all ""Yogurt Raisins"" were made alike!  These are really, really sweet.  Even this sweet tooth can't eat more than a small handful at a time.  They are tasty, though!  Four stars instead of five for the overwhelming sweetness.",4,1
Ideal addition to Keurig coffee maker. This is our second one and this one was $10.00 cheaper. Will recommend to all our friends.,5,1
"Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas.",5,1
I got these as an easy on-the-go snack.  My toddler loves them and will eat them non-stop if I let him!  I even sneak a few of them myself as they are incredibly tasty.<br />They are a little too pricey for me to eat myself though.  Wish more baby yogurt products were as low in sugar as these!  My son refuses more than a bite or two of regular yogurt but loves these.  I don't think he has much of a sweet tooth and prefers the mild tart flavor of these.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the price.  SIGH,5,1
Great tasting product - gluten free and all.  I have bought this before and will buy again.  all pamela's products are great,5,1
"I love mustard & have tried so many different types/brands and this is without a doubt my favorite mustard.  However, it is very spicy, so be fore-warned if you don't like spicy foods.  The taste of this mustard is so delicious that I put it on chicken & seafood before grilling or broiling.  I love this mustard so much that I am always on the lookout for recipes that will allow me to incorporate it. If you like very spicy and delicious mustard, then this is the mustard for you.",5,1

"My 1 cat loves Catnip while the other smells it like as to say....""Are you kidding me?""

"I know that sounds like a hefty title, but this is by far the best gluten free pasta I have ever had! No question about it. For five years I have searched high and low and had mushy pasta, pasty pasta, flavorless pasta, hard pasta, and I'm certain other failing adjectives associated with the pasta I was eating. This is not the case with ORGRAN. The pasta is absolutely perfect! Follow the directions and cook for exactly 8 minutes and even those around you who can eat gluten will love this pasta. Just ask my boyfriend! Buy this! You will be so happy when you do!",5,1
Shipping was in a timely fashion. Package was not damaged. Product was fresh and affordable. Would prefer to have smaller package so I could get a variety of flavors.,4,1
"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!",2,0

"My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!",1,0

"We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.  My husband loves them so much that he doesn't even mind taking a ""kid snack"" to work.:-)<br />I've also found that if we get a box that's been damaged and broken up - the crumbs make an awesome pie crust!",5,1
"I really dislike most Gluten-Free crackers, but just finished a bag of these and remembered that I couldn't find it anymore in my grocery store.  Guess I'll order a pack of 6 - it should be great for lunch with some tuna.  The crackers are solid, crunchy, and have enough salt to make them addicting... but not that crazy oversalted taste of most yucky gluten-free rice crackers.<br /><br />Ingredients list that this contains Milk & soy... so not vegan?  (I don't know much about vegan.)<br /><br />They do contain: Brown Rice Flour, Sesame Seeds, Potato Starch, Quinoa Seeds, Safflower Oil, Rosemary & Olive Oil Seasoning (whey powder, sea salt, sugar, spices, yeast extract, onion powder, natural flavor, olive oil), Flax Seeds, Amaranth Seeds, Tamari Soy Sauce Powder (tamari soy sauce [soybeans, salt], matodextrin [corn], salt).",5,1

"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I was so impressed with this product, I just wrote a letter to the company (S & M NuTec)that developed and make them, telling them how thrilled I am.  I've got 3 elderly dogs all on daily medications ( two are on oral chemotherapy, one on Thyroid, one takes Arthritis Medications and one is on Antibiotics)....and they actually LOOK FORWARD to getting their pills!!!  I started out giving them an empty pouch or two then the one with a pill in it....and after the 3rd day, I didnt need the empty pouchs.<br /><br />No more wasted, half dissolved pills or capsules found in corners, no more dragging them out from under the kitchen table, no more cleaning the pill syringe after every use, no more prying open jaws.  NO MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INFLICTED ON MY ELDERLY POOCHES ON A DAILY BASIS.<br /><br />I buy the LARGE size and cut them in half, then mold the pill around it, so I get 60 pieces out of the Large 30 chew bag.<br /><br />I see they now have Chicken available and will be ordering some of them too. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT for Dog and Cat owners.",5,1

"This product is the same great product it has always been. These people who are slamming the product have no idea what they are talking about. Most of the poor reviews are posted by people who work for other companies who wish they had created Cytomax. There is not a better product on the market that literally and completely defeats any and all lactic acid buildup in your muscles. I would have paid twice this much too have had this product when I was still bodybuilding and powerlifting. Now my workouts consist of bike riding, Muay Thai, boxing and some light to medium circuit weight training. Cytomax never fails to alleviate the lactic acid build up from any and all of my workouts. I think it tastes great. These whiners are lucky they do not have to drink the swill that us older athletes had to drink back in the 70's & 80's when your only choice was Weider products or making your own shakes at home (which was the best option)",5,1

We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning ""butter.""

I know that there is a larger container being sold, but a squeeze bottle is a bit easier to maneuver when making drinks I think.<br /><br />Anyway, great product. Will be buying again in the future. :)",5,1

It was not.  The K-Cups that I got in the Green Mountain assortment were Dark Roast.  These from Amazon are not.  And, these are disappointing, by comparison.  These do not offer a full-bodied coffee taste, and are somewhat harsh.  The Dark Roast Hazelnut K-Cups were much richer and more mellow to the taste.  I went to the Green Mountain web site and could no longer find the Dark Roast Hazelnut K-Cups.  What a shame!  I cannot fault Amazon, but I wish that Green Mountain would bring back the Dark Roast version.",2,0

"I've tried several nutrition shakes from Muscle Milk to more natural ones and Orgain is by far the best. The ingredients are the cleanest and best quality, it's USDA Organic, and it tastes great.

"Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix is the only baking mix I use now since going gluten free.  I find that I can substitute it cup for cup for flour in most of my baked goods recipes.  (Except yeast breads...I still have to experiment with it there.)  I use it in my mom's old muffin recipe and I think they come out as good, if not BETTER than when I used to use regular wheat flour.  If you are allergic to nuts, this is not for you since it has almond flour in it, but for recipes that call for nuts (cranberry walnut bread) I find that it actually enhances the flavor.  I have also made brownies, corn bread and chocolate chip cookies with it.  I have served them to non-gluten free people and they had no idea they were ""missing"" anything.  I have tried other GF mixes and making my own mixes of flours, but they are never as good...they usually have too much of a bean taste.",5,1

Oh my goodness-we can enjoy pizza with the rest of the family! We are grateful!",5,1

"I tried Cascal, the only other wine grape soda pop I know and it's unpleasant. This, however, is great. It doesn't taste like soda pop, you can taste the wineness of the grapes. It's like a reflection of wine. It's enjoyable and not sweet tasting (but not sour either). No fake sugar, either, so no bitterness or after taste.",4,1
"My wife and I like to enjoy Italian style appetizers yet avoid the ones really high in fat.  So we tend to choose things like bruschetta, tomato with fresh mozzarella, etc.  We also make the same at home.  There were several places around us where these dishes were always better than what we were making at home.  We realized they were using something other than regular balsamic vinegar.  It had to be a reduction of some sort.  So, assuming they were making this stuff in the kitchen, we asked owners of two restaurants how they made their glaze.  To our surprise they both showed us a bottle of this stuff.  It's sweet, a little pricy but you don't need much.  It's extremely flavorful.<br /><br />Two sliced tomatoes, a tablespoon of olive oil, a little garlic, salt, pepper and some of this glaze makes the best quick and dirty tomato salad you've ever had.  We are snacking well these days!",5,1
this is a great tasting coffee a little to acidic for me  full bodied medium roast good aroma I'd recommend it,4,1
"The company messed up my order, then would not respond to my request to return the item.",1,0
"My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.",5,1
"As others have said, for an instant coffee, Sbux via is tops. It will never be as good as fresh brewed quality coffee, but hey, if you're at home then don't be lazy and brew some real java. This stuff is perfect for backpacking and camping- I also brought a large amount of it when I travelled to India and Nepal...my fellow backpackers were begging me to have some...Overall, it is the best instant coffee that I have ever tried. Try some.",4,1

"This product used to be a five-star for me. I was thrilled to find that I could order it through Amazon in quantity, at a great price. This most recent shipment was my third - and I noticed that the can was different. But nothing on the can indicated that the product had changed, so I thought it was only a cosmetic makeover. WRONG.<br /><br />Many people have noted in their reviews that they like this product because it is not as sweet as the other flavored coffees; well, now it is, AND there's less coffee flavor.<br /><br />I looked up the company's website and e-mailed customer support. They confirmed that they have ""reformulated"" Cafe Francais, and said would take my comments into consideration. I urge everyone who is unhappy with the ""reformulation"" to go to [...] and ask General Foods to PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS. If enough people complain, they WILL listen!<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm scouring all my local grocery stores for the ""old"" cans of coffee...",1,0
"I was looking for a new cat food for my cat who is almost 2 years old - he enjoyed his old food, but after reading some articles on the differences in some popular brands I felt compelled to give him a more nutritious product that contained less fillers. I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant.",5,1
I've used Meat Magic for years on all types of meat; it never fails to enhance. All of the seasoning blends are outstanding and the 24-ounce canister is very cost effective.,5,1
"This was a great product overall.  It looks realistic, dispenses candy easily, and the kids loved it.  Based on the picture, I was expecting all white candy dispensers.  I got 4 blue, 4 pink, 4 black, 4 white.  The description does not say that the 12 pack would be a rainbow pack.",4,1
"First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.",5,1
"I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.",1,0
"The box came open with two sticks missing. It's not worth the effort to return and refund, but when you order a pack of 100 you want a pack of 100.",1,0
"This tea is great for me, as the rich flavor is so good that I do not sweeten it with anything.  I would recommend this to anyone that would like a tea that could be utilized without sweetners. I am on my 2nd batch and would not trade it for others. I believe the addition of the pomegrante flavor is the key.",5,1

"I love this oatmeal and believe me, I have tried them all.  It's super easy to make in the microwave and had a great, nutty taste.  I had a bit of honey and cinnamon to mine for flavor.  I recently purchased this for $1.50 for a box of 5 pouches.",5,1

"I love real (i.e., English) Heinz baked beans.  However I have to give these a low rating here becuase I just received a case of 12 cans and they were so badly packed they were rattling around in the box.  When I opened the box, 5 of the cans were so badly dented and I will have to throw them away.  One of them was leaking.  I know I could return them but that is too much trouble for $10 worth of baked beans.  I can't find anywhere else on the Amazon site for leaving this kind of feedback for the seller/packer, so I'm leaving it here.<br /><br />I will still love the other 7 undented cans.",2,0
"I love the Quaker Soft Baked Raisin Oatmeal Cookies. They are by far my favorite.  When I don't feel like baking, or it's too hot to do so, I grab these.  They live up to their soft baked claims.  They are also even better heated for a few seconds in the microwave.  Definitely almost as good as homemade.",5,1
"If you are a coffee snob, you will not like this cappuccino.  However, for those of us easing into the world of coffee, this is a nice and sweet caffeinated beverage with only 80 calories.  It tastes just like the cappuccinos you get out of the machine at a gas station.  A nice treat!",5,1
"I really like this instant miso.  It is delicious and much better than the other instant ones I have tried.  I love the convenience and the little bits that make it hearty and satisfying.  My only complaints are the MSG and large amount of sodium.  A couple of people in my family have strange reactions to MSG, and I wish I could get the soup without it.",4,1
"The only problem with these mangos is that I eat them too fast.  They would be really cheap, if the bags did not disappear so quickly.<br /><br />Do not expect something packaged in fancy containers.  These are cheap because they are just barebones organic good food.",5,1
"This Santa Cruz soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie is one of the best ever. They flavor it with wonderful spices that make me think i'm eating holiday pastry. When I put out a plate of cookies they are always the first to go. I call them the adult cookie that children love. The price is good and delivered to my door, what more could you ask for.the whole line of cookies are wonderful so try them and find out for youself. Happy Eating :)",5,1
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.",1,0
"...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!",1,0
"I ordered several cases of this item, but only one was sent to my friend, for whom I ordered one.  I received a message that they are no longer available.  I'm not happy about that at all.  Please try to get these back on your website and can you let me know if you do.  Thanks.",5,1

"We only fed our son rice cereal for about 2 weeks - he vastly prefers the taste of oats. This cereal mixes instantly, and combines well with other foods. The addition of DHA and probiotic supplements is an important factor in our decision to buy this product.<br /><br />It was a little disconcerting to open the cannister for the first time and see that it had settled to the point that it appeared only half full. The label says this may happen...it's a shame that so much packaging is wasted, though.<br /><br />Tip: We saved the scoop from his formula and use it to measure the cereal from the cannister.",5,1
"Great gift for Reminiscing about old times.  Got this for my grandfather for holidays.  He and my grandmother talked forever about the candy and different situations about the past in relation to the candy.  There was not a ton of candy.  I like it for the price but tend to like the hometown favorites vendor a little better as far as responsiveness, packaging and amount of candy received.",4,1
I bought all different flavors of jerky from this brand and it is sooo gross. I had to spit it out. Never again.,1,0
product is excellent as a training treat or just an everyday treat.  My dog absolutely loves them.,5,1

"Tried making this pizza crust but it just never got off the ground. I mixxed it in my bread machine and when I dumped it out it was too runnny to work with. Sticky dough on the floured board, sticky dough on my hands, sticky dough still in the bread machine pan. (Runny dough too). I added more gf flour, at least 6 times totaling over 2 cups and then gave up. We have been spoiled by Kinnickinnicks premade pizza crusts. I will try the Arrowhead mix 1 more but what a nightmare!",1,0

"I bought five different jams for my husband for 2010 Christmas.  He opened the marionberry first.  He didn't say much, just nodded and munched away, which means he really likes it.  I took a small spoonful and loved the strong berry flavor.  I'm not a fan of sugary jams so I was elated w/the intense marionberry taste.  It does have small seeds similar to a strawberry, so it's not intrusive in your mouth - you won't be picking at your teeth.<br /><br />I was looking for a high end gourmet jam and am very pleased that I bought this.  It's exactly what I was looking for.",5,1
"The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.",5,1
"Our toddlers (twins) are great at sucking every last drop out of these food pouches. Great for whenever you're away from home but the kids need something nutritious to eat, quick and easy.",5,1
"This coffee had an off, sour taste. It's almost as if it ""went bad,"" as in Milk that's past the date. I only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag. I certainly won't be ordering this brand again.",1,0
"I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.",2,0
"My dogs go crazzzzy when they see me whip these cookies out. They are generously large and don't break apart easily, which makes them an excellent treat for any type of dog except toy breeds and tiny pups. They are wrapped very meticulously by the manufacturer so even breaking during shipping is unlikely. A+!!",5,1
"The leaves without the bags weigh 0.80 to 0.90 grams.  With the bags, 1.0 grams.  The crushed leaves were perfectly green and dry.  In chewing one bag with gum like a guide in Cuzco instructed me, my tongue and roof of mouth were a little bit numb (like a pinch of benzocaine oral gel), showing it has the expected ingredients. After leaving in boiling water a minute and pressing really well, the used leaves do not cause my tongue to get numb, so boiling as tea must be working correctly.  It requires higher temps for a longer time than other teas, or I can still sense some numbing from chewing on the used leaves. It definitely needs pressing with a spoon on the side of the cup while still very hot. Someone suggested crushing with baking soda but I found the taste to outweigh the any theoretical benefits.<br /><br />I had a cold today and 9 bags seem to be helping phenomenally.  My sinuses are now clear from all the hot fluids, at least. Not a jittery feeling like coffee (3 cups today) which did not seem to help nearly as much.  I am not bouncing off the walls or anything, just feeling nearly up to par.<br /><br />I estimated the effect of 1 bag chewed with gum to be about like 50 mg of benzocaine oral gel in terms of how numb they each make my mouth (50 mg is a small drop and is a little more than what you would use on a small mouth sore).  The oral gel is 20% benzocaine, so 50 mg provides 10 mg benzocaine equivalence in my estimate of the comparison.  Coca is supposed to be 0.5% alkaloids which gives 5 mg from a 1 gram bag, so if benzocaine has the same numbing effect per mg, then these bags contain at least as much alkaloids as they should.<br /><br />The effect is so identical I looked up benzocaine and learned the German discoverer traveled a lot and in 1890 wanted to mimic the pain relief of ""concentrated coca"" without the negative side effect of addiction (or at least habit forming). Benzocaine only works as a local anesthetic.  Benzocaine is being discouraged because at only 50 mg it can cause methemoglobinemia (blocking blood's ability to carry oxygen).  Some people have died.  This is ironic because they recommend coca for altitude sickness (lack of oxygen in the air), and coca does not cause methemoglobinemia unless it is in the form of a pharmaceutical with aniline.  Benzocaine is sometimes used to cut a certain common drug which has caused some people to get methemoglobinemia.",4,1
The title says it all.  The various bars they make are very tasty and emphasize healthful ingredients.  Plus I like how they donate a portion of thir take to peace efforts.  The company must be fun to work for.,5,1
"Wow!  The delivery was right on time as I was anxiously waiting for it. It's the BEST tasting Nut Butter I have ever found!  My husband is type 2 Diabetic and I have 3 boys who love peanut butter so I am always looking for healthy, grainy food to incorporate in my family's everyday lives. Their nutrition and health are very important to me!  Nuttzo is a big hit with my family and it makes me happy to be serving them a nutritious, healthy nut butter that has no added sugars or hydrogenated oils!  This is such a fantastic find!  Thanks to Dr. Oz and the makers of Nuttzo!",5,1
"Great taste, best price around. Fast delivery-will order on continuing basis. Read reviews where people thought this was bitter....I don't get it - they must like brown water not coffee.",5,1
"I love using this thing, yes it makes small batches, but 1 batch makes 12-14 ice cubes which is 12-14 ounces of baby food. Typically when babies start eating they eat 1-2 ounces a day of baby food, so 1 tray lasts 1 week or more.<br /><br />You don't need to make huge batches when they are little and when they are big you just put when you are eating in there and dice it up!<br /><br />People have mentioned issues with cleaning, but I follow the rules for cleaning and make the food with boiled water or nursery water.....and I clean it with baking soda....no mold problems what so EVER",5,1
"Wow, this cereal is really addictive!  A lot of other reviews have (correctly) compared it to ""Cap'n Crunch"", and it's true, it does have the same shape and texture.  But tastewise I'd also compare it to ""Honeycomb"", because once when I had a real craving for ""Honeycomb"" I stumbled on this, noticed the generous amount of fiber, and decided to give it a try.  YUMMMMMM!!  I'm so glad I found it!  It's healthy and has lots of fiber & stuff like that - and at the same time, reminds me of those kids' cereals I used to love!  ENJOY!!",5,1
"I first sampled this bar on a long drive from Albuquerque to El Paso.  It was the only thing I'd eaten since breakfast and it kept me going.  I then ordered a carton from Amazon and was impressed by the crunchiness and the good flavor from the assorted nuts packed in there.  If you've never tried this product, imagine a handful of mixed nuts held together with just enough candy syrup to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />One of my friends thought it was a little too hard in texture.<br /><br />Please note the very low carbohydrate content -- good for diabetics.",5,1
Gave this to a diabetic because candy was not a good option.  They really liked it!,4,1
"I have tasted many different peppermint teas over the years, some of which I have really liked.  But this may be the best of them all.  The taste is pure peppermint, and very good peppermint at that.  There is only one ingredient listed, ""Premium Peppermint Leaves,"" and I believe it.  There are no distractors from the peppermint taste.<br /><br />Taste is subjective, but if you like peppermint tea you should at least try this one.",5,1
"So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.",1,0
This coffee is tops  Smooth great flavor  Great if you make ice coffee......Very enjoyable with breakfast or as a coffee with dessert....,5,1
"yummy, this tastes really good, not too sweet and plenty of fruity flavor. It reminds me a lot of the taste you get from Crystal Lights brand Raspberry Ice flavor. I made it with hot water from my tea pot, then after it got room temperature I put it in the fridge. I have to say it tasted good hot too. If you add 2 quarts of water to your pitcher and then add 4 of these little packets you'll have 2 quarts ready to drink instead of using just one little packet with 16 ounces of water. You'd need ice to add too that way to make it cold enough so I'll just make it my way, 2 quarts at a time... You can always fill your empty water bottle with it before you go where ever your going and you can save the big bucks and use your home drinking water instead of paying to buy water in a bottle.",5,1
"These are beautiful, super fresh Jordan almonds!  They have a wonderful taste and are almost all the same size.  They are carefully wrapped and promptly shipped.  Would definitely order again!",5,1
"Excellent product.  All our dogs love to take their pills inside these pliable, tasty little ""wrappers"" and don't even notice they are getting medicine. Easy to handle, easy to wrap around any size/shape pills.  These are a great find. We keep them in the fridge so they are easier to handle, not ""melty."" Worth every penny.",5,1
I ordered 2 cases and already received one.  Every can was dented.  I wish I had read the reviews earlier because another customer had the same problem.  AMAZON should discontinue this distributor.

"This two reviews, one each for two different flavors of KIND HEALTHY GRAIN CLUSTERS.<br /><br />The first review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS and is rated at FOUR STARS ****.<br /><br />Pretty Tasty<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS a try.  And, you know what?  I was pleasantly surprised.  In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS is a tasty, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.  And guess what else?  Our kids, ages 6 and 14, like it, too!<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium.  It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  1/3 of a cup is about 120 calories.  (However, 1/3 of a cup seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS makes a nice, light breakfast for my entire family.  And my kids like it with vanilla yogurt and fruit, too, which makes a nice snack that even a mom can approve of.<br /><br />The second review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS and is rated at THREE STARS ***.<br /><br />Not Bad<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS a try. And, overall, it wasn't too bad. Not my favorite of the KIND HEALTHY GRAINS brand, but definitely edible. In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS is an acceptable, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium. It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds. 1/3 of a cup is about 130 calories. (However, 1/3 of a cup still seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS makes a decent, light breakfast for my husband and me. My kids did not care for it, but that did not surprise me. I have added raisons, cranberrys, strawberries, etc to, and that helps a lot, but still, it is not my favorite, as compared to other KIND HEALTHY GRAINS choices.",4,1
"I just wanted to follow up to the first reviewer complaining so badly.  These roarin' waters (as well as the grape, cherry, and strawberry kiwi flavors) are great for kids if you start them on these drinks.  There is no junk in these because they are WATER.  MUCH better than the suger loaded bags of ""juice""...now whenever my kids have a chance to drink the regular juice pouches, they hate the taste.  They will seek these out over the other ones any day.  They have always been encouraged to drink the flavored water instead of the garbage....and they have much better taste for healthier stuff now because of it.",5,1
"Yes, I needed to lose weight, and yes, I did try the noodles. Some of the noodles are semi OK with spaghetti sauce. I needed real pasta. I was pleased with the FiberGourmet Light Spaghetti and the Fettuccine, Short-Cut. I didn't care as much for the long Fettuccine. Elbows will be next on my list.<br /><br />I warm up the Morningstar Crumbles and spaghetti sauce in the microwave, while the Fettuccine or Spaghetti is boiling. When the Spaghetti is done, I drain it and add it to the crumbles and sauce. It is a quick low cal meal. Great for a family or group.<br /><br />I also slice chicken breasts (1 per each serving) in a skillet with olive oil and cook it for 10 minutes while turning it often. I then add diced onions and green peppers and cook that for 10 more minutes. I add a can of diced tomatoes (including the juice) and cooked Spaghetti or the Fettuccine, Short-Cut. Then stir it around for 4 or 5 minutes and add some grated pizza cheese. I serve it once the cheese has melted. This serves two people with some left over for lunch.<br /><br />Pasta at 140 calories (not 210) that tastes like pasta and cooks like real pasta, and eats like real pasta. It has my vote. One box is four or five servings. We cook two boxes at a time and put the rest in freezer bags and put it in the freezer. Cooking the pasta is the part that takes the longest time, so we grab a bag from the freezer and nuke it and put it into our low cal Italian dishes.",4,1
"i was concerned that the drawers would be hard to open / close, but to my surprise, they are easy peasy!!!  it is very sturdy, and does not take up too much space on my counter! i love how the top is flat so i can store other items on top..... i love having my kcups organized and easy to access!!",4,1

"In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.<br /><br />As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no ""litter box feet"" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.<br /><br />Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to ""rinse"" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.  Gross.<br /><br />Feline Pine, I need a decent box for this litter!",4,1
"I happen to love flavored coffee, and am always looking for a new one.  I found this brand a few months ago, and have been trying the different flavors.....they are all good!  This one is my favorite though.....it is the perfect blend of Raspberry and chocolate.  I brought it to a meeting, and we spent more time oohing and aahing about the coffee than getting our work done!  It is also a great dessert coffee!",5,1
Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.  The only problem is by purchasing them 12 at a time - they are always in the house and tempting me.  Will never go back to regular chips again.,5,1
I buy these on Amazon every time I run out since they are much cheaper than purchasing them through Wholefoods.<br />They are low in sugar and taste delicious. I love them.,5,1
"We love these fruit ropes so much that we bought 2 boxes instead of one. They taste great, not too sweet & great texture that makes us feel like we are eating candy! My kids are 13 yrs., 16 yrs and 19 yrs. and they all love them. I wish the product was around when they were younger!",5,1
"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",1,0
"Big fan of Red Vines so wanted to try grapevines out.  It didn't disappoint for sure.  The grape flavor even though artificial was as good.  The red vines/grape vines product is by far the best licorice vines out there.<br /><br />One good tidbit to know is that if you leave in the open over night it gets hard, which is a good thing in my book.  Right out of the package the vines are really soft.  These were also used for candy station at the wedding and was a big hit!",4,1
"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",5,1
I have tried lots of k-cups and this is one of my favorites.  it is very creamy and smooth.  The Hazelnut flavor is subtle.,5,1
"I bought my golden retriever his first Galileo bone about 4 years ago.  He *loves* this bone, and it is the only bone he has repeatedly gone back to over the years (and believe me, this spoiled dog has been able to sample just about every bone ever made).  It's impossible to break off large chunks, so it takes a very long time for it to wear down.  I finally just bought him his 2nd bone a few weeks ago, and the original one is probably still a third of its original size.  He chews on it 5-6 nights every week, while the rest of his bones collect dust.  I can't recommend it enough, especially for those ""power chewers"".  I don't know what they do to the bones to retain the flavor, but it works!  Don't let the expensive price tag fool you--they last for years.<br /><br />Update 10/5/10: Believe it or not, my dog still loves this bone!  I've gone through another two in the last few years, but how could I not have one for him?  He chews on it virtually every day.  I'm glad to see the price has gone down a bit since I first started buying them.",5,1

"First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!",5,1
"I consider this the best k-cup coffee out there for real coffee drinkers.  At least for those who want a nice bold cup of coffee like Starbucks used to have before they went to the all McDonald's like ""Pike's Place Roast"" all day policy. The boldest and most flavorful of all K-cups. This is great coffee. I brew two K-cups to fill up my cup first at the smallest cup and the second at the middle cup and it is still nice and bold, tastes great. In the afternoon I brew two at the smallest cup size.",5,1
"My dog loves this food and i love feeding it to him. I drizzle hot water over it to give it warmth and some moisture, which my 7 month Lab loves. I believe it enriches the flavor and makes it easier for him to eat.<br /><br />I bought this brand at the recommendation of an employee at a pet store. I'd been feeding him Hills Science Diet food and wanted to switch to something healthier. I'd never heard of the brand and just bought it at the guidance of the store employee. I got home and did my research and found out that this is a good holistic brand of dog food. I was very delighted and surprised. I bought this 30 pound bag when the 5 pound bag of the Wetlands formula ran out. It lasted about 2 months now and i've just put in an order for a 5lb of the wetlands formula (I believe he like that better than this formula).<br /><br />and thank god for Amazon and its Prime shipping. buying a 30lb bag of dog food would have cost at least $20 in shipping fees. I love the price of this too. Its about $10-$20 less than the other formulas.",5,1

Picked up a package of this pasta and only added olive oil as the directions suggest. Absolutely a wonder summer dish. I would definitely not add a sauce to this because I feel that it would kill the flavor and balance. Olive oil and parmesan cheese.

"Wow! I had no idea how many different flavors HappyPuffs had!  We came across the 'banana' flavor recently and it is just as good as all of the others, from Apple, Greens, Sweet Potato and I've even seen Strawberry!  Banana though seems to be my little one's favorite right now, she's big into signing and seems to like banana everything! Banana puffs are a huge hit, the ""banana, mango, peach"" pouch too!  These truly do melt in her mouth which makes me comfortable with giving these to her.  I compared these with cheerios and there are a ton more vitamins and even digestion aids even in puffs which are perfect for a toddler.  With significantly less sugar then other puffs or cereals, being organic and safe to eat, these are a huge hit!  I also appreciate the amount of puffs we get in a container for the price, it's a great deal.  I have been even using the left over plastic containers for storage when we are done!

"I like this green tea. The pomegranate makes for a unique taste and very pretty color also. It contains stevia already so you probably will not need any sweetener added. I have one of these when I feel blah, and the antioxidant properties really do make me feel better. I would give it 5 stars, except I noticed that if I drink it on an empty stomach, I feel a bit queasy. I'm sensitive that way though so it is probably just me, but to make sure I always have a couple of organic crackers first (I recommend Back to Nature crackers). This tea is a definite pantry staple for us.",4,1

"Wow, this is good soup!  At first sip, it reminded me of Campbells, but it's not quite as sweet, is more tomato-ey, and is richer because of the butter.  It's addictive, especially because it's so quick to serve (no struggling to dissolve milk or water into it).  I can polish off a whole can just as a snack.  I've also mixed in brown rice or whole wheat pasta for a healthy feast.  Great stuff!!",5,1

"This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.

I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.",4,1
"I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert.  Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores.  I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun.  We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor.  It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce.  In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like.  (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor.  Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue.  As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.",5,1
"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.",4,1

"As is true with most gluten-free versions of popular products, you will be disappointed if you're expecting gluten-free Rice Krispies to taste and behave exactly like the original.  Snap, Crackle & Pop are in delightfully full force.  Using brown rice instead of the standard white rice is a nice healthier touch but adding sugar to the recipe isn't; these changes do make the cereal taste a little different, though it by no means has become anything resembling a sugary cereal.  Gluten-free Rice Krispies turn to mush in milk much faster -- but is it really a problem to eat it quickly?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about the treats.  Adding the butter and marshmallows makes it exactly like it was when I was a kid, especially if extra marshmallows are added.  They are incredibly moreish, taste and act exactly like the original and do not last very long around my home.

"Update:after a week or so of drinking this, I decided to stop because I was having some odd health problems (upset stomach, etc) and a lot more sinus/allergy problems than normal.  I decided that it might be the Acai berries, that were causing the problem.  I looked on the internet and the berries are associated with some stomach problems.  I really did like it, especially diluted somewhat, but it's not worth the aggravation.  If you don't think allergies will be a problem, here's what I thought of the product:<br /><br />I decided to try this flavor additive for bottles of water because it is decaf and also, unlike most of those flavor-adds, it does not use Equal or some other sweetener.  I can't drink much caffeine at one time (more than a couple of sips can really mess me up) and I also can't use Equal or several other of the sweeteners.  This tea uses honey and the natural sweetness of the strawberries and the Acai berries to sweeten the green tea that is the basis of the beverage and it doesn't contain caffeine.  It mixed very easily with the water and had a nice taste.  I don't like my bottled water to have very much flavor, so I tried changing the ratio (it was one packet to each 16.9 bottle) to see how using half strength would work and I liked that even better.  I ended up just putting the bottle of water with the flavor in it inside my fridge door and I just get a glass of water from a plain bottle and then add however much of the flavor that I want.  My boss liked the flavor, too, when I gave him a glass full.  I wasn't sure how to tell the Acai berries from the green tea, but I could definitely taste the strawberry, so if you don't like strawberries, you probably need to skip this product.  But if you love them, maybe you've found this year's summer drink.",4,1
"I simply LOVE this tea! It is yummy, full of flavor and the best part is the caffeine!

"Since I'm constantly trying to get enough protein (it's recommended one has at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight), finding a good breakfast cereal has been an issue for quite some time.  If I'm limiting my caloric intake, making certain that such a large proportion of that intake is from protein is very difficult.<br /><br />So many cereals deemed ""healthy"" aren't as healthy as they would have you believe.  My husband, for instance, bought some Smart Start cereals, but if you look at that label, it's clear that the cereals just aren't that good for you.  That one has over 200 calories per serving, almost 20g of sugar per serving, and only 5g of fiber.  Of course it tastes good. So does Frosted Flakes!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus, on the other hand, is actually GOOD for you.  Don't be fooled by the plain Special K cereals-- they are missing the protein they need to make those cereals balanced meals.  This cereal, though, has it all. INCLUDING TASTE!<br /><br />Only 100 calories per serving, 5g fiber (proportionately better than the aforementioned cereal), ONLY 2g sugar, and-- here's the kicker-- 10g of protein!  And, that's what I'm always looking for in the foods I choose-- at least a gram of protein per 10 calories.<br /><br />And, what is really surprising is that this cereal is delicious.  I like cereal with flavor, and this has it. The texture is crispy, but nicely soggy in my skim milk, and there's a hint of nuttiness to it.  Additionally, it's sweetened slightly.  Sometimes, though, I sprinkle a packet of Equal on it if I am really craving something sweet.  Either way, it's very very good!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus is perfect for breakfast and it's perfect for an evening snack.  It's great any time of the day.  Finding a low cal, low sugar, high protein cereal that is moderately low in carbs was impossible before this came on the market.  I can't praise this highly enough!",5,1
This coffee is the best. I like the part where there is no after taste. Just pure goodness to the last drop,5,1
"Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit.",1,0
"Natural didn't mean less fat or carbs, and it was pretty tasteless, actually! It did pop fully, not alot of unpopped kernel's, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again.",2,0
This dark chili powder has so much more depth of flavor than regular chili powder.  I don't use any other brand.,5,1
I switched from the box cereal to this particular kind thinking it was better and it made my son have diarrhea!!!!  I'm switching back to the box cereal.,1,0
"I just received this order, I'm drinking this tea as I'm writing this, it taste terrific, smooth, not too sweet, flavor is just right, best tea I've ever bought so far, will definitely buy more like this and try other flavors.<br /><br />Thank you so much!",5,1
Our australian shepard puppies love these! and they are the perfect size for training and to put in their treat balls.,5,1
"The taffy is soft and full of flavors. I am going to order more. I just love it. I was taken back to my childhood days. If you like good taffy, this is the one for you.",5,1
"I feed this to my puppy along with the dry formula to get her to eat more. She now is licking the bowl clean!<br /><br />She does seem to have large bowel movements with this, but it is getting her eating and I know I can trust the ingredients.",4,1
I have tried many flavored coconut waters and Zico offers the best tasting coconut water with the lease amount of calories.,5,1
These sticks were awesome. My frenchie gnaws on them for hours and there is no odor like other bully sticks.  They are a little wider than I thought but my dog can still go through them without any trouble.,5,1
"As soon as my dogs hear that I open the box they come running.  They absolutely love these chews! Don't know what it is, but they're irresistable to my dogs!",5,1
For a quick easy treat this is a wonderful product. I also love that it's sweetened with cane juice and made with real fruit puree. I don't feel bad giving this to my kids.,4,1
"Oh my goodness, but these are good!  The company should make larger bags because one bag can be consumed by 2 people in one evening, with a little salsa and a couple beers!  These are so delicious!  I signed up for auto-delivery so I don't run out!",5,1
"I could not find my Romeo's favorite dog biscuits in the local stores anymore.  Luckily I had an almost empty box and found the toll free number to the company.  I was amazed at the friendliness of the girls I spoke to.  THANKS TO BLUE DOG BAKERY and your wonderful customer servie, my dog now gets his biscuits by the case.  5***** and paw prints to Blue Dog.  Barb Ross (and Romeo)",5,1
Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.,4,1
"This ""veggie"" pasta purports to sneak in a serving of vegetables and as well have less fat and calories than the original Mac 'n Cheese. It's easy to have less when you change from a 7.5 ounce to a 5.5 ounce portion, which I first noticed when I poured the pasta into the water. It's a lot less than a normal box, even though the box is roughly the same size.<br /><br />After cooking, the pasta smells vaguely of cauliflower, the vegetable that makes it ""veggie"". Of any vegetable to choose, why that one? What nutritional advantage does it have in its processed forms? Even then, does it really matter what you choose when the chief ingredients are butter, milk, and cheese?<br /><br />The taste is fine, but nothing special. It's not quite the original.",2,0
"My youngest loves this flavor straight out of the pounch and my older kids enjoy it without even knowing.<br /><br />My youngest often takes this in her lunchbox to preschool to enjoy during the day since she can recap it as many times as she would like.<br /><br />For my older kids, this is my favorite product to hide in all of their ""treats""!  The apple & cherry flavoring is delicious in smooties, brownies, cupcakes and makes everything healthier.",5,1
"The cooked grains are soft and creamy. Taste somewhat between a risotto and a barley. Great taste. I believe they will easily capture flavor from what ever they are cooked in, or added to. I used them as a rice substitute and they taste great.<br /><br />Cooking time is about 4-5 minutes. Wonderful grains - would definitely order again.<br /><br />Here's a cooking tip: For a wonderful but healthy smooth taste, add some almond oil on top!",5,1
"I actually didn't buy this through Amazon, but from a local general store in SC. I don't know when the original was out, but I'd never had it before now, so I have nothing to compare it to. I just finished my first ever piece and it was WONDERFUL! I guess if you're being nostalgic, brace yourself. But, if you're trying it for the first time, DIG IN! Just be warned, they are addictive.",4,1
"This product was obviously inspired by the large multinational companies that put out two cereals that boast something like 13g fiber per serving.<br /><br />The problem I have with those products is when you read the ingredients list, you need a degree in biochemistry to understand them. Furtermore, they contain either artifical sweeteners or the dreaded hi-fructose corn syrup, which has no place in a natural foods diet.<br /><br />Here you get the same high fiber as those aforemetioned products, but the list is ""clean"".<br /><br />Whether you desire a high fiber cereal for the health benefits or to accelerate weight loss (see Dr. Connely's book, he's the inventor of Metrix), this is a no-brainer.<br /><br />Congrats to Nature's Path for formulating a cereal with the same fiber content as the popular brands, but with ingrediens that are recognizable.",5,1
"If you want a tea that is easy to get along with and has no tongue-torturing surprises, then PG Tips Black Tea is for you. No fancy oils or spices, just tea the way God and the British Empire intended it to be. I started drinking it decades ago and it's still my favorite. Avoid the odd-tasting ""Special Blend"" and stick with the stuff in the white/blue/green box with the green ""P"" and red ""G"".",5,1
What a great addition to my shakes!  The flavor of peanut butter with a small amount of calories and fat.  I'll be buying this again and again.,5,1
"One of my favorite teas, good, rich bergamot flavor. Hard to find in stores, very good price from Amazon. Thank you!",5,1
"I have to admit this stuff is way too hot for me and I regularly eat all of the tabasco flavors. A friend made a pot of chili years ago and only added according to him, a ""few"" drops of this stuff to the whole pot. Literally to say it far and away was the hottest thing I have ever eaten not to mention the hell it wreaked on my digestive system, Every bite it got hotter and hotter. I thought it had a not so great flavor, but then again it got hot so quick it was hard to enjoy any ""flavor"". Worse than biting into a habenero. Like fire that feels like hotter than possible to imagine and it is very persistent and a long lasting burn. Pretty senseless to make a sauce so hot you need to use this much caution to use it.<br /><br />I think it is more of a novelty item, something along the lines of college guys daring each other to try it is what comes to mind. If you really enjoy abusing yourself with hot pepper extract or you simply can handle ANYTHING and say NOTHING is hot enough for me, then this might be for you. If you can honeslty say you like the burn off this my hat is off to you because you are one tough person. I actually like to be able to put a little sauce on my food and add flavor AND heat not just insanely stupid balls of neverending raging fire. I will pass on this and stick to the varieties of tabasco I love.",4,1
"Four stars because you don't get what the picture shows, you get what the title says -- you get strings of all green, all red, all pink. We REALLY wish we would get the four flavors as shown.<br /><br />However, these are still really cool candies. Though if you haven't had these before, you should know that after eating a bunch (hard to stop!), your mouth gets somewhat ""raw"" or scraped, kind of like eating a bunch of sour patch kids (but zots are more fun).",4,1
"We bought this after reading about it on Dr. Sear's website. Our son has had no problems at all with the formula, we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation (to add calories) Our son was a preemie, and was EBF for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production. Our son took to the goats milk right away, we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it, then were able to give him goats milk by itself. The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about. Good thing our son loves it, because that's what really counts! It's 1/3 the cost of convential (cow's milk based) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest. It's a win-win all around!",5,1
"Hands down the best vinegar I've EVER tasted.  Subtle, nuanced, and compatible with everything.  I use it with good quality olive oil (3 1/2 to 1) with kosher salt and white pepper.",5,1
"This is some mighty good stuff!  I have tried several different brands and this is<br />the best yet.  So far, I have only tried it on tomatoes (slice 'em thin), onions,<br />squash and okra.  TIP:  Dip tomatoes in an egg white before coating with Calhoun Bend mix.  Fixin to use it with fried chicken and fish...Enjoy!!!",5,1
"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.",2,0
i love the green tea moisturizer from PROACTIV but its too expensive hence i bought this. This one is expensive too but it has more quantity. I love the smell and texture but even though it says wont clog pores it does have a little heavy feeling/oily feeling to it. but for oily people like me it still works great. will continue using it,4,1
"This whole wheat gnocchi is like eating twigs in dough, the texture is so rough. I wonder what to do with the other boxes.",1,0
I bought the Chicken flavor and my puppy loves them! It's great for training bcs they are so small. It's the perfect treat to take everywhere. Just make sure you keep the bag sealed so they don't get hard. I use them in the buster food cube as well to keep the puppy busy for a while.,5,1
"As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling. It seems intermittent but frequent and has now cost at least one customer.",2,0
"The Jalapeno tortilla chips have a great taste, not too salty, and a pretty good nutritional profile. Since they come in 6 oz bags, they are great to enjoy while watching sporting events, etc. while not worrying about over indulging.",5,1
"I thought I was buying non pareil candy (like snowcaps), but instead it was a container of sprinkles. I'll find a use for them, but I was hoping for a stocking stuffer (heck maybe I'll make it stocking stuffer andyway).  I would have been better to see a picture of the container- so I knew it wasn't candy.",2,0
"This flavor was originally available everywhere but no longer.  I can not find it at any store (grocery, drug, etc) within a 30 minute driving distance. So, I now order them via Amazon.  I don't like candy but this specific life saver is just too good.",5,1
This is an amazing amount of dog treats that will last a LONG time!!! What a great price!! These are the bones i give my dog after i let her out to use the bathroom and she comes back in. i have other treats for random times so this will last forever. i couldnt be happier!!,5,1
"This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.",4,1
"This is a good assortment for trick-or-treaters.  You usually get approximately 75 pieces per pound, but there will be some slight variations.  Bags are usually available from a variety of sources in different weight bags.  Prices vary depending on the source.  it tends to be in the range of nickle candy.  Alas, penny candy is a thing of the past due to inflation.",5,1
"As a sleepytime fan who loves vanilla this tea is a hit in our home, with Amazon's case prices, and quick delivery it's always on hand and easy on the budget.  Thanks Celestial Seasonings and thank you Amazon.",5,1
"This is the best K-cup apple cider I have tasted.  It also has ZERO calories, a major plus for people on a diet or with Diabetes.  It is a wonderful alternative for those who do not like coffee, hot chocolate, or tea.",5,1
"When I was a kid in Alabama, my dad used Dale's on everything he grilled from fish to wild game. He would tell his friends he could make shoe leather taste good with Dale's sauce. Some 30 years later we both continue to be Dale's sauce fans. For the folks that think it's salty, cut it with applejuice or beer and you'll get the flavor but not the typical saltiness of a soy-based product. Like grilled onions? Put some onions with a little Dale's in some aluminum foil on the grill while you're cooking. Like mushrooms on your steak? Put mushrooms, butter and Dale's in aluminum foil and do the same - awesome! Try grilling asparagus with it - I hated asparagus until I tried it with Dale's! I even make jerky using Dale's to marinate the meat beforehand. ""Oh Boy"" the cost savings!",5,1
I received this as part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />I now many review says is not strong coffee but for me<br />it is just perfect. It is not overpowering and a great flavor.<br />I would says more like tea than coffee.<br /><br />I think is great coffee and I love the little packs.<br /><br />Perfect for the office.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.,5,1
"My pair of cats, old and young are lovers of Temptations. They like the Seafood medley flavor. They will not let me stay in bed in the morning. This Temptation time. After they have their Temptations I can have my coffee. Guess who rules this<br />house.<br />I get my Temptations from Amazon. It is so handy.",5,1
"At 190 calories, these bars provide a great calorie boost with very healthy ingredients.  Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar.",5,1
"My cat adores these.  I crumble some over his (Halo salmon) dry food and he is in cat heaven.  He loves the salmon version, too.  These can also be ""reconstituted"" by adding a little water, as an alternative to wet food.  I love that the ingredient list contains a single item:  Freeze-dried chicken breast.  Simple and perfect.",5,1
"I usually do well when I order Zuke's dog treats. They are natural without a lot of unnecessary ingredients. My 2 dogs love these, and they are the perfect size for training and using as rewards. They are small enough that it is enticing to my dogs and they want to do more to earn another one.",5,1
"My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half.",5,1
This is some of the best pickle I've ever had! Great on papad. Give it a try....,5,1
"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem.",5,1
"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM"">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2"">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>",2,0
This arrived quickly and in great shape. I feed this to my dogs however I personally did not find the contents unpleasant or visibly lacking in quality. I liked what I saw and smelled much better than the Roland brand. My dogs love it.,5,1
"These awesome chips get their flavor from actual jalapeno bits and crushed red peppers.  There is a world of difference between this product and Dorito-type chips that have flavor merely sticking to the surface.  For the health-conscious, these chips have three grams of fiber per serving.  The beet powder gives these chips a red-hot appearance, however they are not too hot.  This product is healthy thanks to the fiber grams, plus it tastes great.  Highly recommended.",5,1
Came as advertised but the interior package had broken open and the santas were roaming free in the box.  It is for my child's school project so I haven't tasted them.,4,1
"What are these people writing reviews thinking?  I bought the Creamy Chocolate Fudge based on the great reviews it got. It tastes terrible!  It has some type of aftertaste that I can't even describe. Gasoline?  At $3 each, it's tough to pour them down the sink.  And it's probably against some evironmental law to pour it down the gutter in the street.  Maybe I'll try the gas tank of my car......",1,0

Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this brand! I tried another and they refused to eat them!

Use this as a salad dressing substitute.  Delicious without any fat calories.  Like the squeezable bottle too.,5,1
"I read about these noodles on line.  I usually don't believe when there is so much hype.  Thought this time I will give it a try.  Don't know why.  The order came in the mail and when it came I had forgotten i HAd ordered the noodles.  I had some sauce I had made the day before, so I rinsed them and dried them then poured the sauce over them.  Pleasently surprised, they were actually good.  The texture is not as a regular noodle, more like a rice noodle.  The taste was good and I plan on ordering more",5,1
"This is absolutely wonderful.  My grocery store doesn't have it so when I saw it on the AMAZING Amazon, I ordered it.  I have ordered it ever since and will continue.",5,1
"I love this little, cool, green, modern-looking container. I use it on my counter for salt. It is the perfect size, and the little 1/2 tsp spoon is very handy. I use it all the time. However, there is one thing that bothers me about it: the silicone top doesn't close completely. There is a gap that is quite noticeable. I understand that it is not suppose to be air-tight, just serving as a cover. But the gap is very conspicuous and takes away from the appearance of the container. If it closed all the way, without the gap, I would have given this product 5 stars.",4,1
our dog is 14 years old and this product is part of an arthritic regiment and it is WONDERFUL she walks like she 6 yrs old.<br />Thanks you,5,1
I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!,5,1
"As a newly converted vegan, there's not a lotta sweet food items I can eat that doesn't have milk or some type of milk product or animal product in it (not to mention refined sugars and bleached flours etc). I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying.",5,1
"These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these. Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'",5,1
This is a great tasting product and the price was right for me from Amazon,5,1
"I decided to try this out after seeing an ad in a Bass Pro Shops catalog. I have two chihuahuas. One of them loved it and could probably lick it all day. The other dog wouldn't go near it. All in all, I think it really just depends on the dog itself; hence the mixed reviews here. It's not a bad product by any means, but probably not something I'll be buying often - just more of a fun treat every so often.",4,1
I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.,4,1
"I buy this product for my two cats. I know there are dogs on the cover, but they sure go ape $#!^ for these chicken bits. These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.",5,1
Just what I ordered.  Did not last long in our house!  Kids were fighting over them.  Would order them again in the future.,5,1
"We've fed this kitten food exclusively to our cats when they were kittens.<br />They were rescues and sickly little sad orphans, when we rescued them from a local<br />animal control, actually, one day before they were to be put down! Well, needless to say,<br />we pampered them to excess. We fed this wonderful food to them, after they were<br />weaned from bottle feeding. Now they are gorgeous, healthy and happy members of<br />our family. As I mention in all my cat food reviews, I am from a long line of Veterinarians,<br />with 4 currently in practice locally. All my vet cousins highly recommend this food.<br />And I recommend all of the Royal Canin line of cat food.<br />You will see the quality and shine of the coat, as well as, the healthy immune system<br />benefits of a healthy and happy cat.",5,1
"This is the second Green Walnut preserve I bought, in hope of finding ""the real thing"" that I recently tasted during my trip to Turkey. (The previous one was Green Walnut Preserve (Gradina) 14oz (400g), also sold on amazon). Disappointed again. It's over boiled, does not smell/taste anything like walnuts, and has a very strange tea-like aroma. It's actually produced in New Jersey, not Armenia....<br />Avoid this product, as well as the other preserve I mentioned. If I find the real thing, I will post updates here.",1,0
"Such a light and tasty snack! My favorite is classic sea salt but they are all amazing! Love these, they're awesome!",5,1

I love my wine saver.  It's easy to use and really does extend the life of a open bottle of wine. For some unknown reason I find it fun and strangely satisfying to use this product - cool to use. I've given as a gift to wine drinking friends and they all enjoy too.<br /><br />I've owned for over 18 months and had no problems.,5,1
I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.,5,1
It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!,4,1

"I was not really excited about instant coffee.  But I was wrong: It's a great alternative to freshly brewed good one whenever it's not available.  When I'm on the road, get a cup of hot water from a gas station and make this coffee.  Soooo much better than the ones found at the store.",5,1
"Most dark chocolate bars tend to be too sweet for my taste. This bar is less sweet than most, but is not bitter. So if you like a strong chocolate flavor without all the sweetness, then this bar is for you. Good price for organic chocolate.",5,1
"My dogs normal food is grain free, and I always like when I can find treats that are similar.  My dogs absolutely enjoyed this specific treat.  We have given them other flavors, but they seemed to go at these like they liked them more.",5,1

"Excellent products and customer service.  You can read my review on the Venus Flytrap product page as well..<br /><br />Joel will quickly get back to you if you ask for help.<br /><br />Please know, that you may receive a Sundew that looks different from the one pictured. It isn't a problem for me, at all.  But you should know, because you may get a green one that looks more ""bunched"" up than flat, and that's okay, nothing to lose your pants over. I actually like the look of mine just fine.",5,1
These treats are a great choice. There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!,4,1
"I purchased a puppy Kong at Petsmart 2 days ago and it came with a free Stuff'N Ziggies. My German Shepherd puppy LOVED it. It was hard enough to keep him busy for a while, but not so hard to discouraged him. He still has a tiny bit left that he continues to chew on during our free time. I intend to get another package for him, he liked it so well!",5,1
"If you are in the market for organic raisins, Newman's Own is a great brand.

"I purchased this because I was watching the Reluctantly Healthy videos on yahoo, and one of them said drinking green powder is good for you. This was the first thing that came up on amazon when I searched 'green powder'. The price was reasonable ($15.00) but when I opened it, it has a strong smell of raspberry and acai berry. When you make it, because its more ground up veggies than powder, it periodically sinks to the bottom so you have to stir it when you want a drink. To mew it tasted like a mixture of pet store food and the acai berry, which I'm not a fan of. The drink gave me a headache, and at the end of my work day it had made me so sick i ended up having to pull over on the side of the road and throw up.",1,0
"I love crunchy cereal or anything that does not turn to mush in 60 seconds. However, this cereal is just way to hard.

"I have been battling colon cancer for two years and, most recently, pneumonia.  In the process of having three surgeries, chemo and radiation treatments I, of course, lost my taste buds and couldn't find anything that really tasted good to me.  Having lost thirty pounds that I couldn't afford to lose, I desperately searched for something that tasted good to me.  Then I discovered Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Baked Pita Chips!  How delicious they are!!!!<br /><br />I have gained ten pounds and could eat three bags of these chips per day except I can't afford them.  No only are they hard to find at stores in the Charlotte, NC area, they are really expensive.  Harris Teeter grocery stores stock them but they charge $3.49 per bag and Bi-Lo grocery stores charge $3.99 per bag.  With so few chips in a large bag, that is really too high.<br /><br />My last order for Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar chips through Amazon was for 24 of the small bags which really doesn't last me long.  By the time I add in shipping and handling for my order, I really don't save any money.  Being retired with a fixed income and incurring so many recent medical bills, I find it hard to afford to buy the chips.<br /><br />My recommendation to Stacy's Pita Chips Company would be to add more chips to the bag and also lower the retail price.  It would be great to have the chips available in discound stores, such as Wal-Mart, etc., in order to purchase them at a cheaper price.<br /><br />Stacy's should give me a free year's supply of the Cinnamon Sugar chips because I have told other cancer patients, a lot of friends and family about the chips and seem to have everybody ""hooked"" on them.",4,1
"A friend of mine who is following an alkaline diet recommended Essentia water because of the higher pH level, so I gave it a try. My usual water selection is either filtered water with Brita system or store-brand bottled water (mostly Perrier). I compared the taste of Essentia water with my usual waters and found Essentia to be somewhat silky, but nothing really outstanding. I like the fact, however, that it provides some health benefit by alkalizing the body's pH balance.<br /><br />For those who don't know, alkaline diets emphasize eating fruits and vegetables, along with proper hydration, and are purported to lead to lower rates of cancer and disease. There is also some evidence that it lowers the risk for kidney stones and might slow bone loss and muscle degeneration, increase growth hormones, and even ease low back pain.<br /><br />I researched what is the pH for other popular water and found a test result from a website. I don't know if the small difference in numbers makes big difference in one's body, but since I drink almost a liter of water every day, hopefully there is:<br /><br />Brand: Source or Feature: pH<br />Essentia: Micro-clustered Water: 8.57<br />Aqua Hydrate: Utah purified water with minerals added: 7.96<br />Evian, France: Spring water: 7.53<br />Dasani: Purified tap water: 7.2<br />Volvic: Natural volcanic mineral water: 7.07<br />Arrowhead Spring water: USA Spring Water: 6.83<br />Penta Water: Micro-ionized: 6.7<br />Fiji Water, Fiji: Spring water: 6.65<br />Deer Park, Maryland: Spring Water: 6.31<br />Perrier Water: Processed water with minerals France: 5.28<br /><br />As for Brita pH balance, I found that Brita purposely decreases water hardness to improve the taste of drinking water. As a result, the pH value of Brita filtered water tends to be in the slightly acid range.<br /><br />With the benefit of Essentia water, its reasonable price and convenience, I will most probably switch Brita system to Essentia water.",5,1
These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands. And this flavor is DELICIOUS.  YUM!,5,1

My mom bought this for me over the holidays.  I was so excited to use it as I wanted to try making my own organic baby food at home.  Being a busy professional I never imagined it would be this easy.  I love the all in one concept.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that it cost $150 but was made in China.  I would have preferred for it to be made in France as I'm sure it used to be a few years ago.  Another thing:  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to secure the blade when I first opened it.  The instruction book wasn't very descriptive about it except for a small picture.  A phone call to the company finally resolved the issue.,5,1
This is my favorite coffee with it's charming fragrance and delicious rich smooth flavor. I use less of the coffee beans compared with my previous coffee blend (previous favorite) since this coffee is much richer and fuller bodied and smooth than any coffee I drank before. I ordered four pounds for this month already. I usually make real Espresso (pump) coffee with my Gaggia machine; but I have been using the drip method (burr grinder) since I wanted to try it out first. It is wonderful tasting just plain without milk or anything added. I did try it with milk too and it tasted good; but I prefer to drink it plain so I can taste the flavors.,5,1
"I have tried Back to Nature products before and always been a little bit underwhelmed, but this product is pretty good.  The granola is not too sweet, which is perfect, and the dark chocolate chunks are great.<br /><br />I was also pleased by the amount of fiber and whole grains, though the product is also higher in fat (6g) and calories (220 per 1/2 cup).  Another plus, I could pronounce all of the ingredients.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bag contained mostly crumbles, so it may have been better eaten with a spoon than by hand.  I'm not sure if putting the snack in a box would have been any better at maintaining the larger clusters of snack or not.  (After all, my Kashi Go Lean Crunch cereal has nice clusters on the top and a bunch of tiny crumbles otherwise.)<br /><br />I could see taking this snack on a trip, as the bag size is not overwhelming and has a reclosable zipper top.",4,1
"I drink a lot of tea, have since I was a little kid.  Though growing up my mom would only drink herbals because she didn't like caffeine.  When I was about 20yrs, I met some friends who were obsessed with tea and taught me how to make loose-leaf tea, not the stupid bagged stuff.  The problem with bagged teas is that with bagged tea you get the worst, left-over part of the leaf, or dust, in those bags, so the quality of the tea is much lower than most loose-leaf teas.  Also with loose-leaf teas you have the option of buying bags you can use so you have your own bag tea as well with whatever quality and quantity of tea you want.<br /><br />  With all that said, I have found ""Numi"" to be a very good tea company as far as mass-produced sold in-store teas go.  They are definitely on the higher end of my list of good teas when you aren't in the mood for measuring your own.  I have used several of their loose leaf teas ( such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MSGMNE"">Numi Flowering Tea Assortment - 9 Varieties</a> )and they are good quality, so I was excited, but apprehensive to try this tea.<br /><br />  This, is for bagged tea, I am happy to say, very very good.  It has a light fragrant taste, and is ideal for night time.  I know green tea at night time sounds like a bad idea, but green teas caffeine content isn't as high as black tea and isn't likely to keep you awake, even for someone like me who is highly caffeine sensitive.  Its just a very nice tea.  The first time I over steeped it quite a bit, but even then the taste was still smooth and the taste of tannins was not too strong, the second time was still slightly over steeped, but could barely taste the tannins at all, when steeped properly, there should be very little or not taste of tannins in this tea at all.<br /><br />  Overall, I was very impressed with this tea, the only reason I can't rate this tea higher is because of the price.  32 bags for [...] just isn't very cost-efficient.  That's equivalent to about 6-8pots of a normal sized tea pot.  I can buy about a 1/2 lb of good quality green tea for that price which will yield a lot more tea.  However, its still a great purchase for people who like bagged tea and I highly recommend it to those who do.  :)<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy<br /><br />  EDIT (11-19-09):  My husband reminded me that although the tea in these bags is great, the string on the bags has a tendency to come off when you try to take it out of the package, which is definitely a con, but does not change quality of the tea, just something to note when taking it out of the package.  :)",4,1

"The other reviewers can definitely give you more information on this type of tea; the purpose of my review is just to recommend it. This is hands-down my favorite tea to drink in the evening as I am unwinding. I usually prepare an oversized mug of it with 2 tea bags, a to-taste amount of clover honey, and a packet of sugar in the raw. It's wonderful! I also sometimes use the same method with one bag of this tea and one bag of Celestial Seasonings' Vanilla Tea. That's also a soothing and relaxing blend. I desperately wanted to find a brand and flavor of tea that I would truly enjoy and after many, many purchases--this is it! This comes with my highest recommendations!",5,1

I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.",4,1

"Since these Shiitake mushrooms seemed a great value, I thought I would stock up and ordered two pounds.  Well,that turns out to be a lot of mushrooms,  One pound equals about 5+ quarts of dried mushrooms, packed tight but not broken.<br /><br />The shiitake's range from medium to large size, with some larger than I expected.  All in all it was a good selection of various size and they all look quite nice.<br /><br />They come packed in a sealed plastic bag that shipped well, so I'm not quite sure what the concern related to pachaging by a previous reviewer was based upon.  You could not re seal the original bag, and I would not expect to do so, but transfering to zip lock bags or quart jars as I did works well.  I store other mushrooms in  glass quart jars as well and this method keeps them dry on your pantry shelf.  I would suggest you order these if you enjoy Shiitake Mushrooms in your stir fry and soups.<br />Great Value",5,1

I bought this product because I am suffering from hormonal acne. I researched about this tea and found out that it can aid in hormonal acne. I didn't want to take spironolactone that my dermatologist had prescribed within few seconds of seeing me.(I HAVE VERY MILD ACNE). What kind dermatologist does that?.I actually went to the derm to get advice on anti-aging and blackheads.(I am 27). I want to start my anti-aging regimen now but he prescribed me a hormonal medication (spiro) along with doxycycline(antibiotics). I was not comfortable taking a medication for something that was not so severe to begin with so while researching about natural alternatives I came across pure spearmint tea's similar properties(anti-androgen). I have been using this tea for about a week now and it seems to work wonderfully on my acne. I haven't had flare ups. I am also taking new chapter food based zinc(60mg) and vitamin d3 and b complex. That could have improved my skin too but I don't know. So far I am loving this tea but lets see how it turns out. I also avoid dairy and sugar.,4,1

"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change.

"I'm an experienced kale chip eater, and usually love them.  And I usually like Indian food.  But I *hate* these Bombay Curry flavor kale chips.  First, I dislike the spicing.  A lot.  I also wasn't a huge fan of the kale itself: the leaves strike me as somewhat small, and there seemed to be a high proportion of spines (which are hard, and not tasty).<br /><br />On the plus side, it was organic kale.

My 16 year old son made this product while I was not home. After 90 seconds the container started on fire. The microwave is burned and my son may have have been injured as the item continued to burn. He used an oven glove to remove it from the microwave and throw in kitchen sink. I am lucky to not be visiting my son in a burn unit now. If you value your home and children do not use this product. I reported this to Kraft who is claiming this is not a safety issue.If it has happened to you report it to Kraft so this dangerous item is removed from the shelves.,1,0
"My little dog gets 1/2 a denta-delicious bone every night. She gets other treats during the day, but nothing makes her more excited than getting her denta-delicious bone.  My local store stopped selling these bones so I tried replacing them with other brand bones for a while.  For her, there was no suitable replacement. So I found them here, online, and now she's happy again!  I would highly recommend these bones!",5,1
"Love these.  One of the few chips that is healthy and tasty, satisfying my salty cravings w/o spiking blood sugar as so many ""diet"" chips do. Not as good as regular chips, of course, but a handy snack for salty snack loving dieters like me.",4,1
"Good stuff, just pricey. It fluctuates week to week. I've seen it as high as $25.99 and as low as $19.99. when it's cheap, buy alot if you can. They last along time in storage",4,1
"This was much chunkier than I expected.  Our baby still can't handle lumpy food, so he wouldn't eat it at first.  But after I pureed it smooth, he loved it.",4,1
"These seaweed snacks are very tasty and addictive. They're chewy with just the right amount of spicyness, and great as a snack for watching TV or movies -- a much healthier alternative to potato chips or buttered popcorn. It's 1.3 calories and 15mg sodium per packet, according to the nutrition label. Each packet has 3 pieces.<br /><br />You can eat these as is, or cut the strips horizontally into very thin pieces and sprinkle over rice, ramen, salads, and even pizza. Sprinkling shredded seaweed over food is a common topping style in Japan such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G5KEY"">JFC - Nori Fumi Furikake (Rice Seasoning) 1.7 Oz.</a>.<br /><br />100 bags is a lot, but don't be surprised if you find yourself eating 6-10 or more packets at a time. If you like seaweed snacks, you may also like Korean roasted and seasoned seaweed, though they are often much higher in sodium. Two very tasty brands I like are: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPV4AO"">ChoripDong Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted w/Olive oil & Sea Salted</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JMSG2"">Roasted Seasoned Seaweed: 3 Individual Packs</a>.",5,1

"I ordered two pounds of Scott's Cakes' Raspberry Butter Cookies, hoping that they would live up to my high expectations. Well, they most certainly did! I can no longer find what I consider to be tasty raspberry butter cookies in local bakeries or supermarkets. Either they are not available or the quality is alway disappointing. Not so with these scrumptious treats. Soft, buttery cookie dough, with really delicious, slightly tart raspberry centers--not the bland, starchy raspberry fillings that seem to be universally prevalent these days. Well done! I'll be ordering more very soon.",5,1
"Man, I love skittles and I hate have to keep going to the store to buy some.  This a great deal on a bulk bag of skittles at discount prices.<br /><br />They take forever to go bad too, so once you open a bag you have more than a month to eat it!",5,1

"I decided to try this coffee and went with subscribe and save to get a discount. I figured I could always cancel if I didn't like it. Well I love it. My only problem is that I run out of it before the next month's supply gets in. It's bold and strong, so if you like that in your coffee flavor, this is for you. Reminds me a bit of a starbucks type of coffee. I Loved It.",5,1
The price and quality of this purchase is certainly a benefit for my household.  Heck I save money and don't have to leave the house for the great taste of a cup of coffee!!  Delivery is automatic and haven't ran out yet.,5,1
I bought these to carry corrosive chemicals in that I use at work to test crude oil samples. They are secure and leak proof and very sturdy. My son grabbed a few to store paint in that he was using for a school project. They are a good size for this purpose. The cost was also reasonable for what I received. So many applications. Even if you might not have a use for something like this you might be surprised how they might come in handy if you have a few lying around. Great little product.,5,1
im from the poconos but moved out of state and have friends in brooklyn who introduced me to manhattan special and i love it i would love for someome to start shipping it. once you try it youre hooked,5,1

Love this tea and have a hard time finding it in South Georgia.  Was so excited when I found it on Amazon and it was cheaper since I bought it by the case!!,5,1
This is my wife's favorite. She grew up in Seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so I assume this is good coffee. She is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine.,5,1
"OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.",1,0
"This is my favorite tea.  I like it because it is caffeine free and I like the taste.  I do add a packet of Splenda.  If you want to make iced tea, my advice is to first brew it in a mug, then add the Splenda, then pour it over ice.  If you brew it directly over ice, then add Splenda, the Splenda doesn't mix as well.<br />I paid $16 for 24 k cups through Amazon.  This is about what I used to pay when I ordered from Keurig, except that I also either had to pay shipping, or order several boxes in order to get free shipping.  The Amazon Prime membership is a great deal.  It is worth the yearly fee, especially at Christmastime.",5,1
Great basket for the price. I gave to my doctor who delivered my baby and he was very impressed.,5,1

Don't even waste your time ordering this bag of soup from this vendor. It's advertised as 1 bag - and you can get 1 bag of the same soup at your local grocery store for under 4 dollars. Haha - this was in need of a review!,5,1
"I used to get these at Kroger grocery in Georgia and NC but sadly they disappeared. If anyone knows a source and would be willing to share that would be excellent. They are a unique taste that does not compare to any other I have tried. I agree that shipping is high but I have just placed my second order. A word of caution though, my first order was basically 6 jars of pickles in a box loosely bubble wrapped, needless to say the box was all wet and to my dismay a tragic scene of delicious Heinze pickles and glass were all over the inside of the box. I notified the company and they credited back the cost of the one broken jar to my credit card but still the trauma lives in my mind as I salivate thinking of what might have been.",5,1
"I USED TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT EVERY MONTH AND FOR EACH BOX OF 115 WAS SPENDING ALMOST $4.00 FOR EACH ONE AND SOMETIMES A FEW WERE HARD AND ALL DRIED UP.  I PURCHASED THESE AND HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM WITH EVEN ONE PACKET.  THESE ARE ALWAYS FRESH,AND I WILL BE GETTING THEM EVERY FEW MONTHS.",5,1

Your dog won't care about it, but some neat folks might care.<br /><br />It's a keeper.",4,1
"After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.",1,0
"I'm currently breast feeding my 3rd baby, and I've never been one to have an abundant milk supply.  I first tried this tea with my first and I felt that it worked, but I bought it at the grocery store (1 or 2 boxes at a time) and didn't drink it more than twice a day in order to make it last.  When I saw that I could get a pack of 6 in Amazon for such a great price, I jumped at the chance (I got a cheaper price by choosing the subscribe and save option) and religiously drink at least 3 cups a day. Not only does it work; it's delicious! I have more milk now than I ever did with my 2 previous kids. And did I mention how yummy it is?  This tea is available in most grocery stores and health stores; buy a box, give it a try, and if it works come back and buy it in bulk.",5,1

Bought a small pkg at my pet store and my little dog just loves them. All natural chicken breast-no fillers or additives which is wonderful. Then found this super deal with Amazon. The price was amazing for 26-ounces. Dingo is a good product even tho they are made in China...wish they were U.S.A. made. The plant is in Ohio and they do have strict guidelines for their products.,5,1

My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.,1,0
Nice mix.  But would only be truly happy if I could pick out which cups are included in the package.,4,1
"My wife and I love this delicate wafer rolled round a delicous chocolate paste. The only problem we encountered is that it was poorly packed for shipping and as fragile as the product was, we had many soft globs of chocolate surrounded by wafer flakes. There was at least 75% breakage.<br /><br />We will try it again soon, but if it comes damaged, it will be return/refund time.",5,1
"If you are looking for flaked dehydrated coconut, look no further. I can't say that I've tried all the brands out there - mainly because I had all but given up on American coconut flakes, that always tastes like cardboard. Similar Brazilian products tend to be less dry, you bite into a flake and taste the coconut natural oils. Well, this is as close to that as I've ever tasted. The flakes might be dry outside, but are still juicy & flavorful. I eat these as a snack and a treat, straight out of the bag!",5,1
Stash is a great brand--we have bought several flavors (lemon ginger is wonderful) and we will continue to buy it over other brands.,5,1

"I've known about Tanka bars for quite a long time, but I never got around to ordering any until now. I thought the recipe sounded really interesting, but the bars are a bit expensive. I finally pulled the trigger, and I'm glad that I did. These are easily the best beef jerky bars that I've had. They are quite soft, and the cranberries provide a nice contrast to the buffalo meat. My only suggestion is to have a napkin handy, as they can be a little messy.",5,1

"I have bought some of the jarred/canned cooking sauces and not been all that impressed.  I bought this a while back and it's been sitting in my pantry.  I finally got around to trying it and was blown away.  I used a pound of shrimp, a handful or two of cashews, and coconut milk instead of water.  Yummy!!!  I may try making a potato curry using a bag of those pre-diced-potatoes-with-onion (not sure if I can Simply say the brand name :-) that you find in the deli case at the supermarket.  I think that will be good too.  And more economical.",5,1

At first I was a little disappointed in the overall size of the popped corn--small compared to the typical yellow variety I'm used to--but the flavor was excellent.  Almost every kernel popped(save for one or two per 1 qt. (popped) serving)!  I love this variety of popcorn and am SO glad to find it at a good price and availability.,4,1
"I am a long time fan of Moroccan mint teas and after reading the mixed reviews for this tea I decided to give it a try as $14 a pound would have been a steal.  Unfortunately the batch I received was completely undrinkable.  After following the recommended steep time and temperature the tea was overwhelmingly bitter and had almost no detectable mint flavor. I tried shorter and longer steep times with the same results every time.<br /><br />It is most likely that the batch I received was old because the mint oil in this kind of tea has a short shelf life, but with the no return policy of this seller don't waste your money.",1,0
"I have tried several Hibiscus teas--loose and bagged. Ambassador Hibiscus tea is far and away the very best. While others I tried were tart--almost sour-- this brand of hibiscus tea is smooth and highly drinkable. The bags themselves are beautiful-- staple free and silky. I decided to try hibiscus tea for its purported health benefits, primarily related to lowering blood pressure, but found other brands so difficult to drink, I almost gave up on the whole idea of drinking this kind of tea. Ambassador brand hibiscus tea is a complete pleasure to drink. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cuppa tea.",5,1
This coffee is as it is described Jet Fuel.  Wow talk about strong coffee.  If you like strong coffee this is your kind of coffee.  Our office couldn't drink it -we are trying another kind.

"Why would I call this the worst spread ever? Because it tastes too damn good. I saw this on the store shelf and took a chance. When I got home I wanted to taste it before I would try it on bread. One teaspoon: Yummy! Two teaspoons: Yummy! Three teaspoons.. let's just say three days later the jar is almost gone and the spread never touched a slice bread. This stuff is super delicious, but I can't see it being an alternative to peanut butter in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's too sweet and would not counter the jelly's sweetness like peanut butter does.",5,1
"Overall, this makes a great fast cup of coffee, especially if you are just going to add a flavored creamer or sweetener to it anyway.  I use two pods to make an 8oz cup of coffee and I am pleased overall with the strength.",4,1

For Weight Watchers folks like me, you'll be happy to know that it's only 2 points / bag. If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.",5,1

Tried several brands and found that duck and lamb make him extremely gassy with a really rude odor.  He loves the fish and sweet potato, his coat is like velvet now in just a couple short months.  No more shedding or flaking and NO RUDE ODOROUS GAS problem. Highly recommend.",5,1

Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****",5,1

I learned about PB2 on a web page where I can log my calories, and exercise. I ordered my first pack direct from the factory, but then found it here on Amazon and get it faster than from the factory. PB2 is only 45 calories for the same 200 calories found in most peanut butter, and it is the same 2 tbsp serving. This is great just as a snack if you love peanut butter like I do. It comes in a powder, and you simply mix 2 Table spoons of powder with one Table spoon of water, stir until thick and enjoy how ever you want. Worth the money!",5,1
"I suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Instead of eating junk food such as potato chips, nachos, cookies, etc., I eat high fiber cereal bars.  I love chocolate.  Therefore, I buy the following:<br /><br />  1.  Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut<br /><br />  2.  Fiber One Chewy Bars, Oats & Chocolate (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z1R1W"">Fiber One Chewy Bars, Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>)<br /><br />  3.  Quaker Chew Dipps, Dark Chocolatey<br /><br />  4.  Kellogg's Fiber Plus Antioxidants, Chocolate Chip.<br /><br />  See the photographs that I have posted on this website.<br /><br />  Naturally, I had to request the new Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Dark Chocolate, when it was offered by the Amazon Vine Program.  I found it very comparable to Fiber One and Kellogg's Fiber Plus.  All three taste very similar.  However, I noticed that the Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar had 4 grams of protein, twice as much as the other brands; only half of the fiber as the other brands; and only one-fifth of the calcium.  Only Kashi had the same amount of protein; I buy this bar for the coconut, which I love almost as much as chocolate.  The Quaker Chewy Dipps had more fat than the other bars but was more delicious; it had a thick layer of creamy dark chocolate that completely covered the bar.<br /><br />  On this website, I posted a photograph that compares nutrition facts for three of the five bars.<br /><br />  If you want a more muscular, lean physique, I highly recommend Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars because they have more protein and less fat.  If you suffer from IBS, purchase Fiber One and/or Kellogg's Fiber Plus.  (Trust me, they work.)  If you crave coconut and chocolate in a healthy, high protein snack, get Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut.  If you crave a semi-healthy snack that has lots of delicious dark chocolate, buy Chewy Dipps Dark Chocolatey; unfortunately, these bars have the highest fat content; 45 calories out of 140 were fat.<br /><br />Joseph B.

"I fed this to my cats (I have 33) and I started having MAJOR problems with urinary infections and blockages from crystals with several male and female cats. I traced it back to the food and found that 1) fish is bad news for cats because of the high mineral content and 2)on top of that Sweet Potatoes are also really bad as they contain a high level of oxalates. People who have bladder and kidney problems due to stones are advised not to eat sweet potatoes so I am going to assume that that is true for cats. Sweet potatoes and herring are not foods a cat would eat in the wild anyway. Bottom line stay away from this food, urinary blockages are serious and your cat can die within 48 hours without expensive intervention (like thousands of dollars expensive). Since I switched foods 6 months ago I haven't had the problem again.",1,0

"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.",1,0

"Like all other products from Bob's Red Mill that I have tried, the quality of this flour is excellent. Very finely ground, no lumps at all, very fresh and always come in perfect packaging.<br /><br />The color of it seems almost white when the flour is raw but as you cook it, for some reason it becomes a whole lot darker. Even a tiny bit of it gives to any dish a strong blueberry-like color. That can sometimes look a bit unattractive if you are cooking for others. I made for instance a broccoli soup with broccoli, potatoes, chicken broth and I used this flour to thicken it. I only added a very tiny bit of flour, for a big pot of soup, but the whole thing turned dark purple. Now I guess a dark purple soup does not exactly match what most people would expect a broccoli - potato soup to look like lol. But fortunately I just cooked it for myself and I'm not really picky about how the food looks.<br /><br />It also holds a very strong, somewhat bitter taste. A little bit of this flour will not only be very visible in any dish but also you will be able to clearly taste the black beans. I was using Bob's Red Mill garbanzo flour before this, and that one, instead, had a very mild flavor and a very pale color.<br /><br />Personally, I will not buy this flour again because the color and especially the flavor are a bit too much for me (I will probably go back to the garbanzo flour or the white beans flour), but I still give 5 stars because I think it is the best you can realistically expect from a black bean flour.",5,1

"I've been using xylitol for a few years now.  It has many health benefits and dental uses, do a web search for yourself and see how great this stuff is!  It's an excellent sugar alternative for those of us with diabetes.  We can indulge our sweet tooth without the negative consequences.  Until recently I didn't know that so much of the xylitol on the market was made in China from corn that is likely genetically modified.  Sorry, I'm not about to put those mystery granules in my body.  This product by Health Garden is made in the USA from birch.  Sure, you're going to pay more for this than you will for the other stuff, but at least you know what you're getting.  This sweetener tastes identical to sugar, though the granules are a bit larger (not a problem, just an observation).  You can use it exactly like you would use sugar, but be warned, xylitol is dangerous for pets, so if your furry companions have a sweet tooth, don't give them anything made with xylitol!  Also, too much xylitol will loosen your bowels.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol and your body does not process it like it does ordinary sugar.  My only question is, why did the price go up $15 in a week?  The 10 lb. bag was $39.99 when I ordered it last week, now it's $54.99.  That's quite a jump.  I'm glad I ordered it when I did.",5,1
Very disappointing.  I have purchased this in the past from the First Colony website and it was very good.  The coffee in this purchase was very bitter and did not have any cinnamon flavor or cinnamon sticks mixed in with the beans as it had in the past .  We are throwing it all out.  A complete waste of money.  I would not purchase from White coffee again.,1,0
"Love, love, love these chips.  They taste so good baked in the oven with cheese.  I am glad I bought the case.

"Don't the name throw you.  ""Eat. Think. Smile"" isn't the easiest brand to remember, but their baked nutrition bars are certainly memorable in terms of taste.  I tried two varieties through the Amazon Vine Program, Oatmeal Raisin and Orange Cranberry, and I loved them both.  The bars are soft, chewy, sweet without being sugary, and decently sized (a little bigger than a Clif Bar, perfect for a between meal snack or a before-exercise pick-me-up).  Best of all, they were satisfying without being too filling.  I was a little doubtful about how the addition of cocoa would affect the flavors, but as it turned out, the cocoa was only detectable as a pleasant undertone and didn't overpower the Oatmeal Raisin or Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to recommend a food item I have sampled for free, I always ask myself, ""Would I actually pay for this product?""  In the case of ""Eat. Think. Smile"" nutrition bars, my answer was a resounding ""Yes.  I prefer these to some of the other bars I buy at the store.""  Therefore, I am pleased to be able to recommend them to you.  Eat.  Think.  Smile.  And enjoy.",5,1

"Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0"">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.",5,1
"Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them.

I absolutely love peach tea. My favorite is diet peach by Snapple so I was very excited to try the MIO Luiquid Peach Tea but I did not like the product at all.<br /><br />I usually drink 4-6 16oz bottles of water each day so I thought the compact size of the MIO would be good to keep in my purse for when I wanted a change to my routine. The size and convenience was the only positive of this product.<br /><br />The directions specify 1 squirt per 8oz. The first time I tried the product with a 16oz water bottle I gave the flavoring two healthy squirts and the result tasted like cough medicine. Blech! I poured water out and watered that disaster down and managed to finish the rest of the water.<br /><br />On my next try I started out with a teeny tiny squirt and worked my way up to a decent flavoring but it still had a bad aftertaste that just didn't work for my tastes. I'll stick to plain old water or Snapple when I need a peachy fix.,1,0

"I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.",5,1

"Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists are a unique candy, to be sure. I'd never heard of a pomegranate-flavored licorice before, so I was anxious to try it. First the good: The pieces are firm and chewy (I like a little substance to my licorice), they're a good size (about 2 inches shorter than a Twizzler), and the pomegranate flavor is nice. Now the bad: While the flavor is good while you're eating the licorice, a bitter aftertaste lingers (I had to either immediately take a drink or shove another piece of licorice into my mouth to get rid of the aftertaste), and the price is outrageous. At 53 cents per ounce, this licorice is four times the price of  Twizzlers. Is it four times as good? I don't think so. While I enjoyed trying these licorice twists, I won't be buying them in the future.",2,0
"My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!",5,1
"I bought these after hearing they were the best and reading all the good reviews. Previously, I had tried the Wilton markers which were horrible. I was so excited to try these out, but after 4 or 5 cake pops they stopped working.

I don't understand why they didn't work for me but seem to work great for others.",2,0
"Tried these pods since they were on sale, and glad I did.  Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.

"Seriously, everything this company makes is fantastic.  I had a bottle of this sitting at my place for months.  I got it out of curiousity along with my favorite, the Habanero hot sauce (which is incredible) and I was stunned at how well this tasted.  I thought that maybe a sweet and habanero sauce would be to far apart extremes to have great taste but Marie Sharps pulls it off.  Its just sweet enough, and just hot enough, and has a great texture and consistency.  A bottle will probably last a long time.  Great for a dipping sauce with chicken, pork, or Chinese food.  Also, even though it has plenty of sweetness to it (think a premium duck sauce), it has almost no carbs (0.4 per serving).  Which is nice.",5,1

"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.<br /><br />The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.",2,0

However this being said, if you're going to try and cut back on your pop intake and want to put something more natural in your body, I highly recommend this as a starting point.

My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these!

"I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  ""Crunchies"" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  ""Crunchies"" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is ""pineapple,"" so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)",5,1

They dissolve quickly, so no real fear of choking or serious gagging (my little guy has a stronger gag reflex than most kids his age). The product itself is okay tasting-- sort of akin to a rice cake with a little sweetness? My son seems to think they're terrific and pursues them with almost the same vigor as he does his yogurt melts (also by Happy Baby).<br /><br />My only real complaint is the package itself-- the top pops open really easily. I had one open in my checked luggage on a trip once (oh that was fun), then another time when I had a container in the diaper bag for the day (two separate containers, so it was not just one faulty package). By that time I learned my lesson. I actually put the puffs into a Tupperware container after I initially open, because the package does not make a very tight seal (as evidenced by repeated opening) and they seem to go stale quickly.",4,1

"Our little monster, Gary, had problems when he was a kitten. When we rescued him he had flea anemia so bad that he had to have a blood transfusion. His intestines never fully developed and he alternated diarrhea and severe constipation his entire life. We were giving him laxatone and lactulose 2x a day. When he recently had a severe bout of diarrhea and a possible UTI, the vet prescribed Hills Science diet c/d. What a crock that stuff is! I did my own research (and I encourage you to do the same) and found that cats should get their water from their food. The Wellness canned food I feed my cats now has 78% water. After feeding them Wellness for three weeks, little Gary is off the meds he's been taking for three years, and our other cat Sugar has lost weight and is much more active. Neither of them drink hardly any water from their bowls anymore, which scared me a little at first, but is apparently normal and good. Gary has only had a few problems since the switch. Yes, the food is expensive, but we're saving money on vet bills and not having to buy prescriptions anymore. I am more than thrilled with the Wellness canned chicken cat food!",5,1

I give them several throughout the day, so them being small (for a 60 pound dog) is great. I have been using these for years, but just recently started purchasing them online. I haven't really noticed any problems.",5,1
"I used to buy a mocha frappe every single day at my local coffee shop. Needless to say, it was expensive. I had tried many different ways of making it at home and none of them worked until this product. The consistency of it is perfect and it doesn't melt before I'm done drinking it. Just like the ones I get at the cofffee shop, it stays thick until the very last drop. The chocolatey flavor is perfection in my opinion... and I'm very picky, having tasted many of these over the years.<br /><br />Also, one of the problems that I used to have trying to make mocha frappe's at home was that the ice would never get very well blended because my blender is a cheaper one, and I couldn't afford to buy a nice one like those in coffee shops that cost hundreds of dollars. With Ghirardelli frappe mix I don't have that problem anymore. Even with a cheaper blender all the ice gets perfectly blended.<br /><br />I'm not even sure just how much money I've saved since I stopped visiting the coffee shop every day and started using this product, but I know it's a huge amount.",5,1
"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al",5,1
"Because of allergies to wheat and corn I decided to give Dogswell products a try. This is the first dry dog food my dogs will eat without adding gravy or meat or veggies or leftovers and they do so eagerly. It smells good enough for me to eat and they haven't scratched since they started on this product. Amazon's price is cheaper than I can get locally so not only is the food good, it's a bargain at that. I love you Amazon!",5,1
These candies made me violently ill.  There should be a warning in the description of the product. I wish I could give these a zero star rating. DO NOT BUY THESE CANDIES!!,1,0
"I surprise myself by rating this cheese my favorite of all cheeses (and I love cheese, all kinds.) But real Parmigiano Reggiano is so delicious. I love the characteristic amino acid crunch (those little white spots are crystallized amino acids produced during the ripening process.) Even though a pound grated lasts a long time, sadly, you may discover that real parmesan can be eaten in chunks, like a good chocolate, and thus, this pound will melt away like snow. Too good.",5,1
"I'm a fan of Black Licorice.  Granted, they were more dense than I like but filled the need of having something I could snack on at work that everyone else would refuse to touch.",4,1
My  two dogs love this treat. Quality seems to be very good.  Amazon price is  very  competitive.,4,1
"I need to use 2 teabags and let it steep for 10 minutes to get any strength. In addition, the paper used in the teabag itself seems a tad water resistant. The specs sound great; the reality is a disappointment.",2,0
"I've been drinking soy milk for many years and have tried a lot of different brands; Silk is the brand I buy most often. I like to choose organic wherever I can so this flavor gets points from me there. It's a good consistency, similar to whole milk if you've had that before to compare. As far as taste, it is creamy tasting yet very plain/neutral which is good on a number of levels: I can sweeten to taste - for instance with coffee or tea I prefer to use a little agave. In recipes that are savory calling for milk I don't have to worry about altering the flavor towards sweet.<br /><br />These aseptic packages are handy to keep in the pantry so you never run out; they can keep for months at a time. To me, this tastes almost identical to the refrigerated version.<br /><br />I can often find this locally for less so it's a good idea to compare prices.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and recommended.",4,1
"I ordered these bars based on a recommendation from a dietitian I have been seeing.  I recently learned I am type II diabetic and am managing with diet and exercise.  My routine now is to count carbs and make sure I get enough protein.  These bars work great for a breakfast meal.  I can eat it at home in the morning as I get ready for work, or I can take it on the go.  It tastes good and is very filling.  I've been using them for over a month now and I've get to get tired of them.  I'll be ordering more and I'd definitely recommend them if they meet your needs.",5,1
Price for this coffee jumps all over the place -- I used to buy it but not since the price jumped.  Excellent at a maximum price in the low twenties with free shipping.  Otherwise overpriced.  Find something else cheaper.  Five stars for the coffee.,5,1
Sometimes granola can taste a little like sweetened wood chips with a few nuts and raisins thrown in. It's good for you but not particularly pleasant. I am however impressed with THIS product. Sold with the byline of a cereal with products you can pronounce! The real test is whether something that is pronouncable is also edible. The answer is yes! I have eaten it raw and with milk and each time it is both satisfying nutritionally but also in terms of taste. The organic and health food marketplace is becoming increasingly crowded. However there is still plenty of room for tasty and healthy alternatives to over sweet cereals. Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds is a worthy competitor in the healthfood marketplace. Enjoy!,5,1
"If you like barley tea, well... basically, you'll like this. You do get a lot of tea bags for a good price. All in all, I think that it's easy for us to say that we're going to an Asian market to get barley tea, and it'll supposedly be cheaper, and blah blah bleh. But then it never really seems to happen... you may have noticed this phenomenon yourself. ;) So it's better to just order it on Amazon, IMHO.The only drawback-- wow, those bags are big! They're really too big to make just one cup, so I'd recommend making a larger batch. They seem like they'd be good for sun tea.",5,1
Was looking all over town for this and finally found on Amazon.  Love all the flavors.  Will buy more.,5,1
"OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not ""taste great"".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!",5,1
"I bought about a tablespoon of these seeds from a local weigh-your-own-spices vendor and it cost about $2.  This product costs slightly less than $1/oz in bulk, and 2 oz. ($2 worth) fills a tall spice jar.  If you do any Scandinavian baking and use cardamom on a regular basis, it is well worth purchasing this in bulk.  You can divide the stash among friends.  For convenience, it sure beats buying cardamom in the pods, and if you have a means to grind it yourself (even a hammer on a folded piece of cloth will do), it will be much fresher than buying pulverized cardamom.",5,1
I bought several of these as Christmas gifts.  They were outstanding in taste and leaness of the product.  Sometimes summer sausage can leave a very oily residue on your tongue as you eat it.  This product does not do that and is one of the best I have ever eaten.  They easily excel over Hickory Farms Beef stick which is a good product in my estimation.,5,1
"Product 19 is one of my favorite cereals.  The flakes are very crunchy, full of vitamins and make an excellent snack.  The 4 grains plus the malt do the trick.<br /><br />Because of the taste it is an easy way to get the kids to eat something good for them.  However the only drawback frankly is the price.  Here in Massachusetts we can get single boxes for less that the price per box quoted here, however I'm assuming that price can fluctuate from state to state so this objection might not apply to you.<br /><br />Bottom line this is good product, just make sure the volume discount is worth the price.",4,1
"I love this coffee.  It works great with K-cup type brewer even though it is not a k-cup.  Since it is not a full plastic cup, I do store the units in a covered canister.  Using a canister instead of the rack is a small price to pay for the difference in price to regular K-cups.  The coffee has wonderful flavor.  I like a bold cup of coffee in the morning.  If I dont have this, I drink Donut Shop.  I like the San Francisco Bay so much, I get two boxes on auto ship every month.",5,1
"This is a good tea, with a nice minty flavor. The only reason is that it's not a 5 star product is that this is more finely ground (what I expect from teabags) than what I expect from Rishi. Small pieces inevitably end up through my filters and floating in my tea, although they're small enough not to be noticeable except by sight.",4,1
This is a great tasting product and a terrific price.  The cost per box in the stores is  much higher.,5,1
My dog cannot get enough of this food after three years! Very practical to travel with but the dog really needs to drink enough water with it. My dog happily drinks all the water that she needs. Thank you Amazon for getting it to me so fast.,5,1
Good looking unit that fits nicely under the Keurig brewers.<br />Sturdy - Well worth the price<br />Remember it RAISES the KEURIG - be sure your unit still fits under your cabnet.,4,1
"Because of the picture and description, I expected 34 different coffees, perhaps with a few duplicates. What I didn't expect to get was 6 Green Mountain French Vanilla, 6 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette, 6 Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream, and 4 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry. I also received 2 each of 5 other flavored, and 1 each of 2 other flavors.  This is not my opinion of 34 different flavors.",2,0
"After years of being unable to eat butter due to dairy sensitivities, we were delighted to discover Pure Indian Foods Organic Ghee. Not only is it packed with nutrition, it gives us the opportunity to enjoy the taste of a much missed staple. Apparently, according to Nourishing Traditions proponents,  it aids in digestion, as well. Although ghee is often compared to theater popcorn butter, we have found the taste of this ghee in particular to be much milder and natural tasting. We will definitely keep this stocked!",5,1
I love this stuff plus its 100% wheat. Highly recommended. I buy two at the time to get free shipping.  This is good for you if you are health conscious. plus it tastes good.,5,1
...including holding ice cubes for a teething toddler.  The muslin is strong but of a weave that allows liquid to flow easily.  The drawstrings are long and easy to manage.,4,1
"These are awesomely delicious!  I found them in individual packs in a local health food store, and as with any food item, recommend trying them out before buying a pack of four.  The cookie part is a bit crunchier than what you'd expect from something resembling a fig bar, but I wouldn't describe it as dry.  The filling is great if you're a fan of berries (I am) and there's more of it than one might expect.<br /><br />Notably, there are some gluten free breakfast bars that have soft exteriors, but really skimp on the fruit filling.  These are basically the opposite of that and all the better for it.  I love them :D",5,1
Amazon stopped selling these for awhile.  I just received my order and am quite pleased. These are very fresh and tasty.  I'm glad I ordered them.,5,1
"Don't be fooled by these wannabe Fruit Gems. They're disgusting.<br />Anyone remembering the delightful taste of the SunKist candies will feel like they've just licked a tire in the driveway of someone that owns a lot of dogs.<br />Truly Fruit come in several flavors like gasoline, aluminum, and cat poo.<br />If you were stung by these hideous imposters, seek out the original SunKist Fruit Gems immediately.",1,0
Have been feeding this to my dog for 1 1/2 years; she really likes it and the ingredients are high-quality.,5,1
My 4 year old loves these pretzels.  They have a sweet salty taste.  We use them as snacks and in recipes.  They do have more fat content than most pretzels.  Not a big deal for a kid though!  Best price is on Amazon with the discount and free shipping.  Grocery store sells them for ~$7.59.,5,1
"My vet was shocked by how improved both my male cats were doing since I switched to this formula..not only could I cut their portions so they would trim up but they were noticeably healthier and though they are close to 8yo, they started having energy like they were half that age. You will not regret spending alittle more for this high quality food and your cats will thrive on it.",5,1
"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky.",5,1

This risotto is delicious. Once you tasted this you'll never go back<br />to any other brand. PERFECT  I find this very hard to find in any of our<br />South Carolina stores.,5,1
We did not receive our order.  We were informed that it was shipped and then (ONLY)a couple of days later we were informed that it could not be delivered by the shipper.,5,1
Great snack or breakfast for anyone on the good. Great for kids before school. Tastes like homemade banana nut bread. Would definitely buy again.,5,1
i have to agree that these are delicious tasty cookies.  i'm not a vegan & i don't have a problem eating gluten. i just like yummy cookies & these cookies are yummy!,5,1
"I've guessed that I could duplicate the taste of this spice mix by other means.  I was wrong.  This is the most wonderful blend of flavors, not only for chicken but for other meats and vegetables.  Frozen chopped spinach is easy, cheap, and delicious with chicken.  For butter chicken, I use less butter than the packet recipe indicates, with no loss of flavor.  The flavors blend together with whatever you're cooking and mmm, the sauce is so good on rice.  Well worth the price.",5,1

Those did NOTHING for my chocolatey cravings!!!!<br /><br />Mini wheats chocolate  is my  favorite chocolate cereal<br /><br />what do i love about this cereal?<br />I love that it actually tastes like chocolate..it has a smooth chocolate chip filling inside of it like a truffle. The frosting also adds a unique experience.<br />I also love that it is multi grain with a good range of vitamins. A healthy chocolate snack...although sugar is kind of high.<br />I also love the texture...mini wheats are so much fun to eat!<br /><br />only con is it is a little pricey.",5,1
Get them on sale if you can...these chips are wonderful....however be careful..you might eat the bag in one sitting as they are not low fat or low calorie...and they sure are good.,5,1
"I was a little skeptical of this when I bought it and I'm skeptical still. However, I'm not sure if it's the honey or maybe just a placebo affect, but I seem to have more energy when I use this honey than when I use store bought. I drink at least a pot or two of coffee a day and I always use honey in my coffee, this actually seems to give me a noticeable, though small, boost of energy throughout the day; and I don't feel AS tired. One thing though that does irk me is the small amount for such a high price, I wouldn't hesitate to use a subscribe and save if it was offered, because I really do enjoy this brand. BTW this type of honey is wonderful for toast, it has such a thick consistency and creamy texture when spread that I don't know how I'll use store bought ever again.",4,1
"I really like this four.  I use it to make bread for sandwiches, and to make peanut butter cookies.  It does make heavy bread though, so beware.  Much better for you than white flour, but not always as useful.",4,1

"Over 70 years ago my Grampa took me to the beach almost every day., To me, highlight of the outing was when he bought us ""Orange Crush"" in the heavy dark brown bottle, from the vendor boy.  Back then the juice was unfiltered and there was even small bit of orange in it.  For many years I hve tried to find something to drink like the ORIGINAL OC.(to no avail)  I use my seltzer siphon and if I tinker with the amount of syrup I can get really close to perfect.  I am so glad I bought this, just great.,",4,1

Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!,5,1

"Just got a Keurig machine as a gift, and don't really know what coffees i would like.  My favorite brands of regular coffee don't seem to make k-cups.  I got this to try a bunch of different ones.  Some were really good, some ok, some pretty bad.  We kept a notepad by the coffee machine for my wife and I to keep track of how we felt about each one.  Now we are going to order a few boxes of our favorites from this set.<br /><br />If you are not sure what you will like in k-cups, or want to have a wide variety on hand for guests, etc, this is a good box to buy to get started.",4,1
"OMG! I got it today in the mail and I've already tried all the flavors. I have to say, they are all very delicious, not exactly the same as ice cream, but a perfect substitute. My favorite flavor is vanilla, its sweet, but not too sweet and best of all its only 37 calories per serving!",5,1
"I love this product, and every other flavor that I've tried (grape, mixed berry, and strawberry). However, I didn't like this flavor at all. It has a strange bitter aftertaste.",2,0
"This is a great product. My son loves this drink and it's constantly ""out of stock"" at the local grocery store, so I have been buying the packets for him to take to school with bottled water. I do still buy the gallon version of this drink WHEN I can find it... but this is great for on-the-go and school lunches.",5,1
"Something I never thought of before is why they only put Kool-Aid or Crystal Light in pre-measured packets.  It wold be much more convenient sometimes, like at the office or on vacation, to be able to make just one glass instead of having to make 2 quarts or however much it is for Crystal Light ""singles"" pouches.<br /><br />Mio Liquid gives you that kind of flexibility.  Just squirt one shot per 8oz of water and instantly your water has some flavor in it.  And if you're like me you might want to add more than one shot per 8oz just to make it stronger.<br /><br />Overall I can't find anything to say negatively about the product.  The liquid is less messy than powders and no worrying about any residue left at the bottom.  The taste is pretty much the same as Crystal Light or sugar free Kool-Aid.  And really the flexibility of being to add just as much as I want would make it a better buy than powdered stuff.<br /><br />That is all.",5,1
"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!",5,1

"One of the most rewarding projects I have taken on is fixing 60 cats for a TNR program. Purchasing the cat food and getting it home can be overwhelming BUT not when I go to Amazon. I shop their sales and purchase by the cases, I buy the ones that say Super Saver and get free shipping right to my door. What was once getting very hard for me is now made possible again. My cats love all the flavors and have a huge selection to choose from. The packages are easy to open and so are the cans. I wish the meat and gravy ones could come in bigger cans but I can't complain just smile and open 24-40 cans a day.Thanks Amazon and Friskies for making me part of your family  :)",5,1
Soup was delicious. No complaints at all except for the price.  Which unfortunatly is to be expected with gluten free food.  Why Heinz doesn't sell it more over hear is baffling.  Just as good as cambells minus the gluten.,5,1
"These don't taste like good for you food, but they are. My 2 year old loves them. I wanted to clarify something written in one of the other reviews -  that these bars DO NOT contain hydrogenated oil.

Either way I get a perfect serving of tea.",5,1
"full dose is very sweet(like imitation sweetener).  I prefer to water down to taste and drink as I would water.<br />This stuff is great at the gym and I love it as a pick-me-up on long hikes.  Great to sip on at camp after a long day.  Remember, never put this kind of stuff in a WATER bladder!<br /><br />I would/have suggested this to friends.",4,1
"What a great way to get heavy items like dog food from an affordable and dependable source. I usually by my dog food in a discount box store rather than my local grocery store. That means another trip and more than once, I've run out. With gas prices what they are the convenience and one less trip is well worth looking into having stock items delivered this way.",5,1
"We liked this coffee.  I would prefer a more ""kona mellow"" flavor, though. I disagree with the previous poster, I don't think it tastes like Folger's or other nasty brands.  I dislike super strong coffee with that burnt ""starbucks"" sort of flavor, so this was closer to my taste.  But, to each their own! I did find that the beans were fresh, not stale at all. For the price, it's a pretty good deal.",4,1
"Is this $14.99 for a single jar of peanut butter? Maybe $8 if it was organic.<br /><br />Price discrepancy aside, Teddie Brand PB is by far my favorite.",5,1
I love this coffee. It has much better flavor than other strong dark coffees. Highly recommend to people who like coffee to have taste and flavor after having creamer in it.,5,1
These are so delicious! I love the KIND bars. They travel well and are very filling without being overly sweet. I have gotten my whole office addicted to them. The Coconut Almond and the Cranberry are my favorite bars for breakfast or a pick-me-up snack but if I crave dessert I will grab the dark chocolate cherry. YUM! My least favorite is the apricot one because I am not a huge fun of dried apricots. Just watch out if you are allergic to soy as the Kind + Protein bars have soy protein.,5,1
Made in the US---one ingredient and I can pronounce it-100% liver.  My dog loves it. Its freeze dried so does not have a strong odor--overall a great product.,5,1
The package arrived even earlier than Amazon estimated.  The lemon curd is awesome and much better than having to make it myself from scratch.,5,1
"I have been looking for this.  I had one from SAM sometimes ago.  When I returned to SAM, they do not have it anymore.  SAM is always a hit or miss.<br /><br />I search the web and found it in Amazon.  I am so glad to find it.  I used this every where from stir fried vegitable to bake fish, grill steak, chicken and shrimp.  It taste great!  It is just the right amount of simple spice with low sodium.",5,1
"This is fantastic sparkling water--easily the best I've ever had in 20 years of drinking the stuff (with the possible exception of a German local brand...).  It's crisp, has flavor, is amazing in all ways.  If I could have a Desert Island Beverage, this would be it.  I love Perrier and Pellegrino, and both of those belong in pet bowls compared to this.  THAT'S how good it is.<br /><br />The only caveat I'll add is this--don't pay too much.  The weight of glass adds into shipping.  Just keep that in mind.  That said, I just bought a case. :)",5,1
This is great! It satisfies a sweet tooth. you could add some raw organic carob and/or stevia to make it a dessert :),5,1
"This is, as advertised, extra bold in taste. Maybe a bit too bold in fact.<br /><br />I don't really like bland coffee. I prefer a bolder taste, and this product delivers. In fact, as the French version has it, it may be a bit too ""tres intense."" There is some harshness to the taste, as my palate experiences this.<br /><br />Still, I'd rather too bold rather than too bland. . . .",4,1
"This product is great for Pez lovers, such as myself.<br />However, my overall rating for this product is not a 5-star review.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I ordered this product a couple, few times.<br />Out of most of the bags of Pez, most of the rolls contained broken Pez.<br />Most of these rolls contained Pez that were all broken.<br />This is a major inconvenience if you're going to be stocking your Pez dispensers with these.<br />Hopefully this was just bad luck on my end though.<br />Also, the price was a bit higher than what I was looking to spend.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The bag contains a good variety of flavors.<br />These flavors include:<br />Cherry, Grape, Lemon, Orange, Raspberry, & Strawberry.<br />(I believe these are all correct)<br />I also like the mini sizes of each roll.

"If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!",5,1
These are our favorite chips now. No frying (bad) and No baking (no taste). Certainly the chips are tasty either alone or with Rice dishes. I did not even know they had sweet potato flavor until recently. Will be trying it soon. so many flavors and they were not even in the race few years ago. Health consciousness is definitely viral. Definitely recommend this brand.,5,1
"I have been ordering these for over a year now. Now all bully sticks vary in size, some of these were so big that my shih tzu would eat it in two sessions. I just got a package and they at TINY. Yes, they are still 6 inches in length, but tiny! They about 1/4 the thickness of the ones I used to get. Disappointing, time to find another supplier.",2,0
I just tried this for the first time today.  This is the best oatmeal ever.  The texture reminds me of grits almost.  Just a dab of brown sugar and it's amazing the taste! It is so easy to make.  It beats rolled oats by far!,5,1
"I can't start my day without these cookies with my morning tea/coffee!

"Is $7.95 the price for just one package?  Seriously?  Can someone tell me if you receive more than one package?  The price I paid for one when living in Hawaii (only 4 months ago) was only $1.69.

"Before I begin, I should make it clear that I am not a fan of breakfast cereal -- or even breakfast in general.  I don't care how much the nutritionists wail and gnash their teeth. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day in my book. Give me coffee and kick me to my desk, please!<br /><br />But for Bob's Red Mill Honey Almond Granola, I make an exception. I would eat this as a cereal seven days a week from now until Bob's Red Mill runs out of oats. It's not too sweet, not too crunchy, not loaded with ingredients I don't know or can't pronounce (or both), not too hippie, not too yuppie, not too sun-drenched fields of happiness commercials.<br /><br />What's in it?  Oats, honey, canola oil, almonds and vanilla.  That's it. That's plenty.<br /><br />How to serve it? That depends on your schedule. Out of the bag and into the right hand, on the run - that works if you're in a mad-dash hurry. Right-handed? Use your left hand to catch the granola. Ambidextrous but drive a stick shift? Use either hand.  If, however, you prefer milk on your cereal instead, use a bowl.  And a spoon. And wait until you've parked, please.<br /><br />Not in a hurry? Pour a few ounces into a bowl, bury it in water and nuke for 2-3 minutes. Voila - almost-instant hot breakfast.<br /><br />Need a snack? Grab a handful out of the bag.<br /><br />Hate raisins like I do? No worries! There aren't any of those pesky little former-grape critters to pick out and destroy.<br /><br />Love raisins? Add 'em in! They'll be right at home, whether you're serving your breakfast or lunch granola or snack hot or cold. Amazingly versatile product!<br /><br />So Bob's Red Mill, employee-owned Oregon Nirvana, has moved yet another person closer to a healthier lifestyle. They're to be commended, not only for having some of the best granola on the planet, but for holding to the highest standards of product quality and customer service known to mankind. Yep, I'm a fan of both their granola and their corporate mindset.",5,1
"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.",2,0
"My husband and I are big fans of hummus, so when we saw hummus chips we had to try them.  Little did we know they would become our favorite crunchy snack. The Olive oil, lemon, and feta combo is perfect - and amazing with dip, cheese, hummus, and just by themselves.<br /><br />Even better - eating a whole bag (as we often do) isn't even that bad for you.  We are both gastric bypass patients and this is something we can eat without feeling any guilt - we just enjoy it.<br /><br />In fact, we just finished off a bag of these delicious chips with a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt ranch dip (another amazing guilt free alternative).<br /><br />Highly recommend giving it a try - you'll be hooked just as we are.",5,1
"We love Q tonic so much, we've set it up for the automatic delivery from Amazon. It's not at all sweet like the horrid stuff you buy at the grocery store. Very dry with a great quinine tast. Really fine bubbles. I believe it's also lower calories than the usual tonic waters. It also is superior to some of the other premium tonic waters, such as Fever Tree. Very light, crisp and refreshing. It makes a nice drink on its own with a slice of lime. Let's the true taste of the gin shine through.",5,1

"Remember those spearmint green leaf candies?  That's the smell that hit me when I opened the sealed individually wrapped envelope at the Hilltop restaurant in Ephrata, PA.  I saved the envelope so I wouldn't forget to write the review.  I can still smell the spearmint the next day.  If you like mint tea, this is a good one.  Bigelow is one of my favorite teas anyway. (Bigelow, Twinings, Stash, Tsao).  I have been a big-time tea drinker since I was a little one.<br /><br />There is a nice hefty taste of spearmint in this tea and it is a full bodied tea--most enjoyable.<br /><br />I like a variety of good quality teas and flavored teas.  I find them probably as enjoyable as many people find a special ale or a special wine.",5,1
"Ingredients say coconut water from concentrate and natural flavor, not sure why the flavor is needed, but tastes almost nutty or toasted, probably from the heat process used to concentrate the juice. I like enough to drink it, but may decide to change brands. I ordered it because it was about half as much as it was at Whole Foods Market.",4,1

I eat organic candied ginger for an upset stomach or when I'm craving something sweet and it's the only thing I have available. I think these ginger mints taste much the same except for the texture. I was surprised at the pepper comment since candied ginger has a peppery spice flavor which is expected. They remind me of Altoids only slightly less intense. To my knowledge this is the only brand that makes organic mints in this flavor. At Amazon's current price point these would be a bargain even if they were not organic.,5,1
"I am a heart patient with Type 2 Diabetes intent on living forever and keeping all my extremities.  I attempt to eat a diet that is both salt and sugar free.  I have prepared my homemade jellies and jams for at least thirty years.  After being diagnosed with diabetes I initially gave up my homemade for tasteless 'sugar free' diabetic jellies and jams from the supermarket.  The jellies I created with Gelatin reminded me of the WWII surplus 'Jello' fed in Army mess-halls in the 1950's.<br />It took me but two tries to get it right with Pomona's Universal Pectin.  I like my jellies a bit tart with very strong flavor.<br />My recipe for ""Pomegranate & Cranberry"" jelly is:<br />1-  12 ounce can of frozen Old Orchard Pomegranate Cranberry Juice.<br />2-  24 ounces of water.<br />3-  1/3 cup of Real Lemon.<br />4-  1 1/2 cup of granulated Splenda.<br />5-  5 tsp. calcium water.<br />6-  5 tsp.

It also came from a different shipper this time that required a signature for delivery, I wasn't able to be home for signature though, so my poor dog had to suffer with grocery store canned dog food for a couple days.

"For purposes of this review, I made a cup of Yogi Green Tea (Pure Green 16 Count Box) and now present my findings.  I used Chrystal Springs Distilled Water, which I brought to a rapid boil and then poured over the tea bag in a medium sized mug.  I dunked the tea bag ten times and then covered the mug with a plate for the three minutes recommended on the tea box.<br /><br />The freshly brewed tea has a faint, grassy smell.  The taste is mild, with a slightly bitter after taste.  The taste reminds me of the green tea served in Chinese restaurants.<br /><br />Next I brewed another cup of the Yogi Green Tea, added a teaspoon of orange blossom honey, and two slices of a honey-bell orange.  This is a delightful beverage.  The mild green tea allows for the full flavor of the honey and orange slices to be experienced.  This last cup of tea is the one I recommend.",5,1
I love the taste of this tea and use it afternoon and night hours instead of coffee. I have no caffiene overload with it and keep hot water ready for a cup anytime.,5,1
This capsule will ONLY WORK in the Lavazza Blue espresso machines. It is NOT a K-Cup.  I tried to alert Amazon to the error in the listing but they have not corrected the product details.  I gave it 4-stars because I have a Lavazza Blue machine and this is great espresso!,4,1

I don't know what is creating that odor and taste since these are not expired. I will not order these again. I don't know how some of the adult reviewers who are eating these can stand them.

I order it through Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" program, which makes these a very good deal indeed.  What makes these cookies an even BETTER deal is that you can make them healthier by substituting ingredients.  This mix calls for one egg and 1 stick of butter.  Instead, I use the egg and a generous 1/4 c. peanut butter plus a generous 1/4 c. plain yogurt (and a bit of water as-needed for consistency).  No butter necessary.  They still come out good, and I feel even better about them.  Eat & ENJOY!",5,1

"It's been years since I tried an International Coffee flavor, and I find that the brand has definitely improved. Years ago, their coffees had a bitter aftertaste that I didn't like. I didn't find that problem with Pumpkin Spice Latte. Yes, it's instant coffee and as such not quite as good as coffee made the regular way, but I enjoyed the pumpkin spice flavor and the ease of preparation. I made it first with boiling water, adding coffee creamer after it was made. Then I tried making it with hot milk. I definitely liked the latter version better. The coffee has a nice foam on top and takes just a couple of minutes to make. A good choice when you're in a hurry or at your desk.",4,1
"Chocolate is one of the few luxuries accessible to anyone. Researchers say that it even boosts endorphins in the brain, those feel good chemicals that decrease pain and heighten mood. But most of us love it for the sheer sensual taste and texture. Lesser quality brands can give the impression of eating brown bees wax, and while preferences and tastes vary, quality chocolate can make your eyes roll back in your head and for a few seconds your whole existence becomes only taste buds and ecstasy. So where does Newman's Own stand on the chocolate experience scale? Again, that's subjective. But my opinion as a chocolate lover is that it's one of the best I've ever tasted. The first thing you notice is that it immediately begins to melt in your mouth.  In fact, I tested the theory with one square of the bar, and it did completely melt without making a single bite in a minute or so. The flavor is very rich, creamy and flavorful without being the least bit bitter. It's made responsibly using organic materials and I like buying Newman Products knowing that they give all profits to charity and in the 26 years of their existence have donated over $300 million to worthy causes. How does it compare in regard to value? At around $2 per ounce it's about half the price of Amedei - No 9, the chocolate bar judged as the best in the world by the Academy of Chocolate. Be aware that it is a chocolate bar and not in a decorative box for giving as a gift. But for a small slice of heaven in the privacy of your mouth it's a great choice.",5,1
I ordered a case of these pretzels and they came in a timely manner.  I ordered peanut butter cheese crackers which came at the same time.  They were not damaged in any way BUT the the coating on the pretzels had melted during the trip and each individual 100 calorie pack was fused together in one big mess.  They tasted fine though and my grandkids didn;t seem to mind the fusion which had taken place. I would recommend them if you buy them in the winter.,2,0
"This is a perfect iced tea - just what we were looking for.  Yes, it is strong, but it will make two servings out of one K-cup.

We don't like tea that is too sweet and the pre-sweetened K-cups are just too sweet - so this is perfect.",5,1

I sent a package to my son's school so that for special events they have them on hand, and my son isn't excluded....in fact just yesterday they had a Teddy Bear Tea, and even he was able to have a plate of cookies like everyone else in the class.<br />I am so glad we found these...",5,1
"On a pure taste basis, this sauce gets 5 stars. (I am not going to address the nutritional aspect. Read the nutritional label and you can see that this is not ""clean eating"" or health food. But if you want healthy food, you're probably not reaching for something that says Taco Bell, anyway.)<br /><br />I love spicy food, and I found that this sauce has a nice zip to it. For sensitive tongues, it may even be too spicy if too much is used. It's nice and creamy with that smokey chipotle flavor coming through the spice.<br /><br />This sauce works well on tacos, sandwiches (although a bit runny), and nachos or layered taco dips.",5,1

The jar is big, and you get 4 of the big jars, so plan to eat a lot of rice. I'm hoping to experiment and find some new ways to cook the basic product so I can have more variety than I get from small variations in the cheese and vegetables that I mix in. Judging from posted recipes, everyone goes to the same variations (parmesan/asiago/romano with asparagus/spinach).  Makes a meal with a breast from a little roast chicken from the grocery store.",4,1

"I recently picked a bushel of Jonagold at a local orchard, and was asked to bring an apple dessert for 14.

No luck --maybe this type of dessert is too old-fashioned.. so I decided to give the mix a go.

Not sure what the quality issue is here.  I would still be comfortable with recommending buying but keep you expectations a little sheltered.<br /><br />Initial Review<br /><br />I just started eating this - I have been using the Madhava instead of honey - honey is expensive and seems to be tough on my body - I don't have the same negative reactions using agave.<br /><br />I understand what the recent negative review said about Agave - I suspect some/much is true.  HOWEVER, this agave taste so smooth and buttery - WHAT THE HELL - LIVE HARD AND DIE YOUNG!  I don't even bother putting this on cereal because it is a waste - I just drink it from the bottle to fully enjoy all the taste.<br /><br />Here is the reality - I don't get the same negative effect as I do other sweetners - so whatever it is - there is something different - at least for my body.<br /><br />Other products from Wholesome Sweetners inc. the molassas and honey are FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I have only had one 44 oz bottle - NO quality problem with the product that I have.",4,1
"My son would not breastfeed so I had to supplement and eventually supplant with formula. It was difficult finding one that did not make him constipated or give him gas pains. I learned that at the young age of 1-2 months it's bound to happen with any formula but this seemed the most gentle on his stomach and eventually he got used to it (at 3 months). This formula has a touch less iron than the the other brands, has a good taste, doesn't stain as much, and is the only formula I know of with probiotics for their immune system (important if your baby is not getting breastmilk). Only draw back would be that it does not dissolve easily and is more expensive than other brands and comes with lesser value coupons. Nevertheless, the positives outweigh  the negatives, and I would use this with my next child from the beginning if breastfeeding doesn't work out",4,1

"I have purchased Ideal for about a year now but discovered that the product sold in the store was promotional and the big chains here in Massachusetts are not selling it.  Major Bummer.  I sent the Ideal folks an e-mail about the situation--they were the ones who told me about the distribution problems.<br /><br />Ideal contains as the first ingredient, Xylitol which is found in sugarless gum.  Xylitol has the benefit of being dentally positive (it actually promotes to a degree some dental benefits) whereas sugar as we all know is dentally negative (sugar is food for bacteria and the bacteria byproducts, poo as it is, causes dental caries).  That is the reason I use it. One only needs to calculate the cost of dental bills to decide to add Ideal to one's shopping list-- along with floss and fluoride rinse.<br /><br />I find the taste of Ideal to be better than sugar as there is no post sugar dryness in the mouth.  The pink, blue yellow and other fake sweetners have a horrible aftertaste which Ideal does not have (at least in coffee and ice tea). The only bummer is that the Ideal company is not doing a better job of promoting this product.  But such is life.<br /><br />I do agree with some writers that the Ideal folks should be upfront about calories.  Sadly the Ideal folks are following the letter of the law that allows companies to say no calorie when in fact there are calories.  The oil in the can spray products are a big offender here as they list their serving size to be 1/3 of a second but if one calculates the amount of fat calories in a small can it comes to about 1400 calories, all from fat.  Ideal should not take this route and should be upfront.  5 calories per teaspoon with diabetic and dental benefits is, in my book, a positive selling point.",5,1

"Keep in mind citric acid is not the same as ascorbic acid, which is vitamin C. It can be used to preserve vitamin C in canned foods though. It can also be used to add a sour taste to food, in beverages, to buffer the effects of hard water in laundry to make soap work better. Any acid can buffer the effects of hard water though, white vinegar is a cheap route to go usually. But for clothes you don't want a vinegary smell.<br /><br />Personally I use a small pinch in neti pot solutions. It enhances smells and seems to clean out my sinuses better when it's used. In 8 oz of water my recipe is a very small pinch of citric acid, 1/4 tsp of a no-additive salt, and 1tsp of xylitol.<br /><br />50% of the world supply of citric acid is from china if that makes any difference to you.

The white plastic of the mesh is surprisingly impervious to staining, and the plastic structure is strong and flexible. It's not the finest mesh I've come across so some dust will end up in your tea, but it's as good as most of the commercial filters.<br /><br />The lid that helps keep steeping heat in the infusor when steeping doubles as a holder for the infusor when you take it out of the tea.  It's very useful for the office and anywhere you can't get to a dish for holding the filter easily.<br /><br />I like it a lot.",5,1

"Ok, I'm a diehard P19 fan. Way to go Amazon for keeping this product alive!  My question is: What the heck is the matter with Kellogg's? Put some advertising dollars into P19. According to Wikipedia, the product has been around since 1967, but the vast majority of Americans have never heard of it.  Get a clue Kellogg's!",5,1
I love these vanilla wafer cookies ... very tasty and sweet. They don't taste exactly like original vanilla wafers and the texture is more hard than original wafers but they are still great.,5,1
"While Spectrum organic shortening doesn't market the product as organic palm oil, the ingredients on the label state that the product is ""mechanically pressed organic palm oil"".  My wife loves this oil as it is a healthy fat containing medium chain fatty acids like coconut oil.  It doesn't oxidize under high heat making it great for cooking.  Also it doesn't add any negative flavor to the mix.",5,1
"Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so ""light"" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.",2,0
"Everyone here gave the Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Apple) a thumbs UP!  It was refreshing, not loaded with carbs!  Not too sweet!  Nice green apple flavor!  Nice size cans too!  If my teens will drink it, hey, I'm happy!  They loved it!  They did like the green apple better than the clementine..the clementine was a bit stronger tasting, but I liked it!",5,1
I picked up the taste for pickled onions when i lived in England.  If they make you squint when placed in your mouth theyre just right.  These were pretty close to perfect for me but I like the London Pub ones better.  I also tried Judy's sour pickled onions but they were too sour for me.,4,1
Great taste but  pricey<br /><br />Really fast turn around. I am very satisfied.,4,1

"I'd have to say this sauce is tied with Blair's Pure Death for my new favorite. My heat level is about a 5 or 6 and I'd say this is about a 6. I'm not some idiot who likes to take table spoons at a time. If you guys don't like the heat of this, go with Dave's Ghost Pepper or the extract version of this. I love this sauce. Great for steaks and burgers.",5,1
"This is my favorite chole spice mix.  I follow the pressure cooker instructions on the package which are somewhat different than the instructions on other brands.  Most brands suggest cooking the chickpeas separately and then adding them to the tomato/spice mixture.  With this, the instructions tell you to add the tomato/spice mixture to the pressure cooker along with the uncooked soaked chickpeas and pressure cook them together.  My experience is that the final result is much, much more flavorful and the chickpeas have a nicer consistency to them.  I have tried several different brands of Indian spice mixes available at my local Indian grocery store and I consistently find the MDH brand mixes to be my favorites.",5,1
"I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!",1,0
The flavor here screams tropical.....and its lovely.<br /><br />I like this tea sweetened...as the sweetner really brings out  the flavor of the coconut and the mango.<br /><br />Talk about island flavors !!!<br /><br />It dosen't get much better than this...it'll bring you back to the Bahamas or Puerto Rico or your favorite island any time you want to remember the Carribean.<br /><br />One of the top points for me are the box that these come in....I have tried  several forms of tea chests and of course we all have 20 boxes of different flavored teas around the kitchen. I l prefer the cardboard box these teas come in because its better for storage.Easy to get to and handle and store...but I can still throw a few into the tea chest so visitors can claim their  own choices.<br /><br />Of course if they ask me ---this would be in my top three choices.,5,1

"I have been searching for the perfect mocha K-cup ever since I bought my machine.  I thought I'd found it with Green Mountain Cafe Escapes, but was sorely disappointed.  Not only does it fail me with flavor, but it contains instant coffee and chemical cow.  I, foolishly, purchased the 96 count offering, so now I have about 91 cups of coffee that I will not enjoy to the the fullest.  It was a very costly mistake.<br /><br />Save your money on this item and go out and purchase a bottle of good chocolate milk (not the 1% stuff).  Use it with your favorite blend, such as Nantucket, and enjoy.",2,0

This cat food was on a list of possibles for diabetic cats.  The cat liked it.,4,1
"These little things also use the ""stick and dip"" theme to make a snack that is very more-ish. Basically, I can't stop until I have finished the pack. Like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00026S630"">Meiji - Yan Yan with Chocolate Dip 2.0 Oz.</a>, they are not too sweet about the sticks, but the dipping sauce is pretty much loaded with sugar.<br /><br />Again, reading and eating this are not advisable as combined activities, unless you don't mind pink splotches on your books.<br /><br />A great little snack, and a great way to give yourself a sweet pick-me-up with something a little different.",4,1
"I have ordered probably $500 of jerky from various online companies in the last 3 years and I can say this is for sure the best jerky I have ever had.  The hickory flavor is great and salty.  It's the kind of snack you just can't stop eating.  The other great thing is I like the pieces, instead of long strips.  It much nicer to be able to just pop bite size pieces in your mouth, rather than try and use your side molars to rip a long piece of jerky apart.  I have probably gone through eight bags of this product and have two in the cupboard.  Just do it.",5,1

It was a big hit for those that like Vinegar chips like me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I developed an allergy to potatoes, bread, wheat and other starches.  Gives me arthritis for the short answer.<br /><br />So, I use it on my home made chicken wings.  Wow, bangin'. I really like this stuff.<br /><br />I have not tried a whole bunch of Vinegar powder/salt options but this stuff tastes real good.<br />My wife really likes fries and vinegar chips as well.  This was a great addition to my seasonings.<br /><br />BIG DEAL...  This stuff does not have any kind of flower in it to prevent caking. This means those with some allergies can eat it!!!<br />Check first to be sure they don't change the formula on me.",5,1

"I had purchased a bottle of this Manuka Honey earlier from Amazon and it had done wonders for my dog's intestinal problems.  This is my second bottle but the consistency of the honey is far different from the first one I ordered.  This bottle of honey is thin and runny - much more like a sauce than a real honey consistency, and lighter in color.  I have never seen honey this texture in my life.  A new Whole Foods just opened up nearby and I purchased a bottle of Wedderspoon 16+ there.  When this bottle runs out, I will be very interested to see what texture the one purchased at Whole Foods looks like.",2,0
Folgers Brazilian Blend Ground Coffee is a medium blend coffee that is one of my favorite coffee's for my morning wakeup. We have the Kuerig K-Cup coffee brewer and bought a couple of Solofill Refillable Single Serve Filter Cups for Kuerig Brewers from amazon so as to be able to use ground coffee from different manufacturers at a much cheaper price per serving. I like my coffee black and I find this coffee has a good taste which does not leave a bitter or an acid after-taste in your mouth. The coffee also has a pleasing aroma. I find that this 27.8 ounce tub will last two months with using between one and two cups of coffee a day.,5,1
"I ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them.<br /><br />I think I was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over. It started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter's hair in the sink (I had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line)...I noticed red spots along my arms, small bumps and itching. The kids saw red on my neck (which usually happens when I am allergic to something), but then it disappeared within an hour of first seeing it.<br /><br />For the last several years, my previous shampoos and conditioners were mostly PH balanced and all natural.<br /><br />These CLEAR beauty products have a ""common thread"" between the shampoos/conditioners, despite have slightly different smells...They are most abundant in ingredients that may initially detangle, but are drying and irritating on my hair and skin with accumulated usage/exposure. It is now clear that these products are not good for me to continue using.<br /><br />*Not the outcome I had hoped, but found a ""silver lining:""<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff ""raining down"" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.",1,0
"Yes, there is a little gritty texture, but it reminds me of the texture of oatmeal cookie dough or some sort of dough where the sugar is granulated.  This is delicious.  Yes, some of the raisins have sunk to the bottom.  Buy some raisins and put them on your spoon.<br /><br />This is a good product, a good company, and Amazon has a good price.  If you are unsure if you want six jars, spend the extra money at the grocery store (walmart even carries a couple of flavors and even some of the single serve packets) and see if it is your bag.  It is my bag.  Try it on some apples or pears.... Yum.  :)",5,1
"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent. I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact I was purchasing this product in its original size, 11 oz.  When the size decreased the retail price remained the same and I was O.K. with that.<br /><br />However, the price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is ALWAYS another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it  (I did not purchase it at Amazon).  Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here? I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Plus of course additional  shipping Chg.  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted?! On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave this product one star, even though it is excellent, because it is incredibly overpriced and of the many hundreds of dollars I had wasted with the purchase of this product.  I feel like an utter fool, thats because I was one.",1,0
"I picked up this brand of Chai at Marshalls about 10 months ago. Tastes pretty good, and works well as a loose tea. Only thing is I paid $5.99/tin back then. Amazon wants almost twice the price.

My 13 yr old min pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food.She went many days not eating  so i switched to this brand and she went BESERK FOR IT.I now buy it from Amazon because it's a little cheaper and i don't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more.This is a highly rated pet food without the BY-PRODUCTS store bought dog food has.My little girl seems to be more active since i've been feeding her this brand and I feel better knowing she is getting better nutrition.....,5,1
"I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.",5,1
"I have to buy a bag of these at least once a month. The store that I have been getting them at does not carry the HEXtra Premium chews with chlorhexidine. They said I have to buy them at the Veterinarian's Office. My chihuahua and I are very happy to be able to buy them through Amazon for a better price, and no hassle. Delivery was unbelievably quick. Yes, my dog is small, but he can chew like the best, and the ""small dog"" size just doesn't do it. I also like the idea of having that extra (hextra...very clever) ingredient for his teeth, as I hear that small dogs tend to get more tarter than bigger dogs. Milo is one year and NO tarter!!",5,1

"I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a ""superfood""!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me - I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???<br /><br />**update: Amazon customer service was a breeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.",1,0
"I love this drink. I would rather drink crystal light beverages than just about anything else, and they're also much healthier than just about anything. I like to mix half crystal light lemon iced tea and the other half crystal light lemonade. It's like a sweet and tart half and half. As per the instructions one packet makes 2 quarts of beverage, however I find this to be a little too sweet for my taste. I use four packets (eight quarts) in in five gallons of water, I put it in a five gallon water jug and put it on one of those stand alone water coolers with the filter removed. Ice cold half and half on tap, mmm, mmm, good. Amazon has about the best price on crystal light that I have seen, and I can assure you as a crystal light connoisseur I have shopped around. Try it I'm certain you'll love it, although I hazard a guess you'd probably want it sweeter.",5,1
"This tea has worked miricles!  For at least 6 years I have had migraines associated with my period. I reacted to the perscription migraine meds.  As the years past, the severity of the headaches increased as well as the duration.  I have taken this tea the last two months and only had a very minor migraine the first month- none the second- which has never happened in years. I drink cup every other day when I'm not on my period, then increase it to 1 to 2 cups a day the week before.  Then the week of my period I drink 2 to 3 cups a day.",5,1
"Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.",5,1

I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.<br /><br />I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea.",1,0
"I'm very happy with this formula.  My son had slow weight gain and had not been on the growth chart since he was 4 months old.  I breastfed him, but at 1 year the pediatrician said to supplement with formula.  We tried various types of formula, but they all immediately soured in my son's stomach and were spit up within minutes.  I'm so thankful that we discovered this formula because not only does he love it, he also keeps it down and has gained 3 pounds in 2 months.  It's gentle enough for his stomach but contains the extra calcium and nutrients that a toddler needs in a formula.  I'm taking away one star because it smells a bit unpleasant.

"Now of course no dry pasta is going to taste exactly like fresh, but I've got to say, this is as close as I've come. Pay no attention to the title description. This is not spaghetti but a very large (nearly lasagna size) and thick strip of egg noodle. The packages are 10-ounces. The flavor is deep and natural. A-lot of dry pastas these days have very little flavor, this stuff has tons. The texture is also great. These noodles are very ""toothsome"" they are chewy (in that great homemade sense of the word). One thing to watch out for is the packaging. As soon as you open the box, check the bags of pasta for holes. The stripes of pasta are so thick that their corners can punch through the plastic. I found a couple of bags that had been breached. I used one right away and popped some tape over the other one.",5,1
"I'm a left-coaster and we don't see Tastykake products, nor being a near vegan do I indulge normally.  Anyway, the appearance of the product was too compelling and I splurged on an order of these.<br /><br />The picture here, for those fellow un-initiates, is misleading.  It is not like a Hostess pie or a turnover, it's an actual little pie in it's own tiny aluminum pie pan!  The crust is a bit salty, and naturally is not crisp or flaky after being in contact with the filling in a small box all that time, but it is very tasty.  The filling is also not overflowing the casing, like the picture, at best it at least fills the lower crust, but sometimes not.<br /><br />That's just so you have the proper expectations, not meant as a criticism really, because this nasty little devil is great, really excellent.  Miles and miles above the Hostess pies (although it's been twenty years since I tried one), really no comparison at all.  If you're in the mood for something special, check it out.  Shipping was super fast, despite the conservative Azon estimates, so gratification in the near term is guaranteed.<br /><br />If someone franchised this product and got it into supermarkets with the neat little boxes in a rack near the checkout line (to compete with candy bars), they'd sell MILLIONS of these puppies.",5,1

"I checked my past orders of the Stash brand Earl Grey Double-Bergamot tea. It seems I order about once every 8 months. This is now my 3rd order but the first time I bought it in bulk like this. The savings were minimal but worth it. I made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received. It was.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of Earl Grey as a vile and disgusting tea. I love this tea. However, I have met people that I have offered a cup of this tea, and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them. Bergamot, the predominant spice in this tea, is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea. When I smell the tea, I smell a sweet aroma. If, when you smell this tea, it smells like pepper to you, you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it. I typically put cream & sugar in my this.",5,1

"My husband I recently ate at an outside cafe in Geneva, IL.  It was late afternoon so we just wanted something light to eat with a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheese plate that include a choice of three cheese.  One of the choices on the menu was a blue cheese listed as ""Pointed Reyes Original Farmstead Blue"".  It was exceptionally good completly outshining the sharp cheedar and the mild Wisconsin Gouda. So much so that I asked to take a copy of the menu home so I could order the cheese on the internet.  Not as easy as I thought, but I did find it on Amazon and ordered it, after I corrected the spelling to ""Point"" Reyes rather than ""Pointed"" Reyes Blue Cheese.<br />  It was delievered in a couple of days intact and as delicious as I remembered. This really is a standout blue cheese especially if you like a tangy sharp blue cheese.  It is creamy but not overpowering and does not have the musky taste that some blue cheeses do. The only downside was the cost of shipping.  The cheese was $18.00 for a pound but the shipping was unexpectely high at $26.00.  The combined cost makes for a very expensive cheese.  I'm sure I will enjoying eating this blue cheese and make certain that I perserve every valuble bite of it until it is gone.",5,1
"There's plenty being said here about how great these bars are, and I completely agree.  My review is about the packaging.  These bars used to come simply in thick plastic shrink wrap.  Now they come with packing tape wrapped around the 6-pack of boxes as well as in thick plastic shrink wrap.  I don't mind the shrink wrap, but the tape is especially annoying.  It makes it difficult to open the individual boxes, to separate the boxes from each other, and in some cases, it damages the boxes when you remove the tape.<br /><br />To the packager: please stop using this tape and go back to just using the plastic shrink wrap.",4,1
"Product exactly as advertised: 8 bottles containing 2oz ready to eat formula.<br />Although I breastfeed, I don't have the time nor inclination to pump milk to mix with baby cereal or 'water down' pureed food so I use this formula. Ready-to-eat in 2oz was the perfect convenience, especially since the lid screws back on. If these had a pop-top or tear-off-foil top that could not be resealed they would not be very convenient. My baby showed no signs of tummy problems when I introduced this formula. I cannot comment on how these would work as a bottle with the nipple attached because I never used it as such.<br />The bottle cannot be recycled in my CT town's municipal recycling program. I considered deducting a star for that! Alternatively Similac really should use a biodegradable container such as those made with corn.",5,1

"This is my favorite oatmeal!  When Target stopped selling it, I started purchasing it from Amazon.  I eat it almost every morning for breakfast. I cook it in the micowave on a low setting, and it turns out perfect. Just a little Turbinado sugar and cinnamon, and it's ready to go.  I highly recommend!",5,1
"For those tired of paying nearly $1 an ounce for extra-virgin olive oil at your local market this is that rare item: a true bargain. This is a great olive oil, very light, none of the 10W-30 oiliness of some olive oils. Very subtle taste, just a hint of the taste of the ripe olives it comes from. You can use this on anything without the flavor coloring the taste. Great for coating things you're roasting or grilling with a moisture barrier to keep juices in, all with the mono-unsaturated benefits of the oil. The pop-out plastic spout is very good. And the can looks good in your kitchen, where it will impress your movie-buff friends. ""Genco"" was the name of the Godfather's olive oil import business. Well worth it. 128 ounces for your 25 bucks.",5,1
"I've been waiting for Taste Nirvana to be on Amazon for a while!!!!!!!!! When I saw it on Amazon, I got so excited that I had to sign in to write a review about it.  I LOVE coconut water, and I've tasted many different brands of coconut water.  Until I tasted Taste Nirvana, I thought O.N.E had the best tasting coconut water.  However, Taste Nirvana's coconut water is from Thailand, and it is much sweeter naturally.  I highly recommend Taste Nirvana and I am subscribing to it!!! Thanks Amazon! :)",5,1

"As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  Again, the fragrance is pleasantly mild and I've not experienced the usual itching and/or burning with a fragranced product.  Time will tell, but I think these two are going to meet the manufacturer's claims.  Both bottles have a substantial flat base with opening end down to enable using those last few drops, and they are not going to be falling over with the slightest hit of water from the shower head.  These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  Thanks!",5,1
"I love Nutella and I have been eating it for breakfast since I am a kid. Though I would NOT recommend ordering it online. Last time I ordered some, the seal was broken on 4 out of 5 jars. Not sure if it was due to the shipping or if it was like that before it shipped. But then I had to put them in the trash since I did not know. The jar is in much better shape when you buy it at the store.",5,1
"I wanted this product to be great.  I yearned for this product to be great.  It turned out to be fair.<br /><br />If you use the recommended serving size, you'll find you don't taste is AT ALL.  Nada.  Zip.<br /><br />If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle.  You'll have to hunt for the flavor.  Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.<br /><br />It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor.  You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.<br /><br />Oh well.  The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.  Too bad!",2,0
"I have an extremely picky 20 lbs French Bulldog/Boston and for the past 2 years I was not able to find a treat that she would eat (besides human food). One day my boss brought in these Dr. Becker Bites and she went crazy over them.

Not only are they good for her, but she thoroughly enjoys them!",5,1

"I have used the tropical flavor for the last 11 years. Yes I realize that the formula has changed. Does it taste the same? Close enough for me. Does it taste awful? No it is not awful whatsoever. Is the same performance in this jug? Yes it is. It still delivers a great performance boost. Now I must say, that I have literally never tried any other flavor at all ever. The tropical tastes just as good to me now as it always has. The choice is yours, but I recommend this product with no reservations.<br />BG",5,1
"These sesame crackers are soooooo good, soooo low cal, and such a bargain from Amazon!  I love them with garlic basil chevre and Mendicino hot sweet mustard! That combo really brings out the flavor of all the ingredients. They also arrive in a very short time.  Enjoy.",5,1
"These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them.",5,1

"We tried this coffee after having brought home some 100% Kona coffee from Hawaii several years back.  We ordered this along with some Jamaican Blue Mountain and a few other types of higher-end coffees.<br /><br />This is by far the best of the lot.  It has a rich and complex taste with an almost nutty or fruity background character.  Growing as it does on the lava slopes of the hawaiian islands, the beans pick up a significant amount of flavor from the rich soil.  Although we are not frequent coffee drinkers or 'coffee-snobs', when we do drink coffee, this is what we drink.  It's good enough that we went to the trouble of buying a good grinder and moving from ground to whole-bean just to get the added flavor.",5,1

"I have been trying many of the dried fruits from this seller. Some are better than other, and these pears are a little on the less good side. They are a bit gritty and not very flavorful. The dried peaches, for example, from the same seller are much better. These pears are not chewy or tough enough to make them appealing from that aspect, so the gritty texture and lack of flavor stands out. The shipping rates charged by the seller are very high, and unless you buy in quantity the rates are too high to make it worthwhile to shop from this seller. I always put together a larger order of a variety of things from this seller to reduce the shipping costs enough to not be off the charts.",2,0
"I happened on this granola and other Oskri products at the airport (weird, I know) - I had just made the change to GF and was anxious about snacks for the trip.

"When I first saw Krave cereal in the market, it seemed almost decadent (especially the double chocolate variety I chose). I realize many breakfast cereals are only a tiny step above candy, but Krave seemed to be going beyond the pale with their marketing campaign. Even the name makes it seem like some kind of wake-up dose of heroin.<br /><br />Sadly, the product is a different story. Lacking in consistency, a remarkable flavor, and in anything that would make me want another bowl, this cereal is over-hyped to say the least. The big draw, the core of chocolaty goodness, is barely noticeable. The exterior is far too flaky to last more than a few seconds in milk, and there is surprisingly little taste. I'm being totally honest here - I had to couple them with spoon sized shredded wheat to make a decent bowl of cereal.<br /><br />I'm a lifelong cereal junkie and now that I'm soundly middle aged, I have to fight my inner demons while shopping to avoid the gigantic bag of crunchberries or super sugar crack and buy something less sugary. Getting a free box of sweetened cereal seemed like some kind of reward! And yet, even if it's given away, Krave is not worth it.",1,0
"I buy these bars 5 boxes at a time.  I feed them to my 1 and 3 year olds for a night time snack or an on the go 'get by until supper' snack.<br /><br />They love many of the flavors, but banana and peanut butter & jelly are their favorites (well...according to my 3 year old...b/c 1 year old can't talk and eats everything!).  My favorites are banana and lemon.<br /><br />I use them as part of my diet routine.  I keep one with me at all times so that I never get tempted to hit a drive thru.<br /><br />These bars are not exactly a Ho-Ho or Twinkie, but they do taste great and are a good manageable healthy treat to your day!!<br /><br />I tell everyone about them!  Their limited ingredients make me feel good about giving them to my kids!",5,1
The seller was amazing and fast so I would order from them again. But I am sad to say the tea was just not at all what I expected and I drink a lot of tea from many higher end tea houses. It had no flavor of carrots or cake in fact it was dual tasting. I just tossed it after the first cup. I was disappointed because the price was excellent and I wanted an amazing fall tea without paying $30 for just 2 oz from Teavana.,1,0

The product came very quickly and although 4 oz doesn't seem like much, my recipe called for only 1/2 oz, so this pack will go a long way.  Once reconstituted, and added to my pot roast they were delicious. They made the sauce really tasty and earthy.  My family loved them.  I will use them in stews and soups in the future.

"These candies are ok, not mazing...but very useful.<br /><br />Bought these because it says these are made with 30% fresh ginger and are supposed to be helpful.<br />The taste is ok, the candy is kind of like a taffy-but harder.<br />There is a lot of ginger taste as expcted.<br /><br />I find when my stomach turns,which os often these help a lot.<br />I have a hard time with ginger capsules as they allupset my stomach and giv hearburn.<br /><br />For getting rid of stomach issues,these work and quite well.<br />The original ginger chews are goodbut no ida howmuch ginger is in them.<br />They are also super sticky too.<br /><br />The price for these is kinda high as ginger people website sells a large 2lb bag for $10 and it is more than in these small boxes.<br /><br />But amazon has free US shipping,and no tax...so not sure what is better?<br /><br />Ginger people also has amazing candied ginger!<br />It is never hard or bitter and easy to eat (my house ate  5LB BAG in 5 weeks!)<br />Just bought some ""natural candied ginger"" from a website, brand ""The best of all"".<br />And actually spat out the piece I tried to eat.<br />Sure it was a bit cheaper,but it was bitter,fibery (in a bad way) andtoo hard to eat.<br />Normally I can eat most foods easily.<br /><br />I will be ordering these by the tuckload too :)",4,1

"Update:  03/24/2011  The flavor seems stronger and better preserved now.  Can't remember if they<br />had foil lining before, but they do now, and it's sealed well.  Smells crisp and strong. Still runs<br />away a bit, but much improved.  Their Darjeeling gets whoppingly potent on a long brew now, if you<br />want more flavor. Or is it their buying?  Anyway, I noticed it's better.<br /><br />""Teatime"" tea is usually robust in flavor.  ""English"", these days, usually means a very rich, fresh tea, Like ""London Cuppa"", ""Yorkshire Gold"", ""New English Teas"", or others. The Bigelow was surprisingly weak, even when I doubled down.  Bentley's is similarly faded, although a bit more potent.  This tea will not stand up to a dash of milk, more like breakfast tea than teatime tea.  There is a very fine flavor there, especially the fresh-straw aftertaste, but it's a bit weak compared to the teas in today's Brit. flavor race.  I had to pounce on the cup before the flavor volatilized the second time.  Then again, you may want a tea like that of 20 years ago.  If so, this is light but pleasant....like ""Constant Comment"" without the spicing.  It just was a bit lightweight for me.  As happened with chocolates, tea has gotten stronger and better among the fanatics.  Hopefully, they can find a way to capture more of the new flavor.  The quantity in the bag seems generous enough to do the job.",4,1

This mix makes one liter per packet, and yes, once reconstituted, it is in fact The Real Thing.<br /><br />But don't buy it from JVC.  The price is absurdly expensive -- IGNORING their expensive shipping costs, it's 1.5 times the price that I can find it for in my local Japanese grocery, and I thought THAT was expensive.  At this rate, you may as well fly to Japan, fill a suitcase with the stuff, and pawn it off when you return, for a profit of more than its weight in gold.

They melt nicely in his mouth, which is good because he sometimes likes to stuff his mouth with a few at a time.

I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.<br /><br />As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack.

We've ordered this item from Amazon atleast three times that I can think of off the top of my head and have never had a problem with them coming in crushed or unedible.

Unlike the previous reviewer I have 10 CASES of this stuff taking up room in my kitchen.  You'll coil back in disgust when you crack it open and then gag with every mouthful.

"I only got one of these to try so I didn't get to do much experimenting, but here is what I have to say after eating one of them<br /><br />1) yes, the entire thing was completely cooked to a good temperature after 60 seconds.<br /><br />2) this does not have to be refrigerated, making it an excellent choice to keep in a drawer at work or to take with you to school, not sure how well it will sit in a hot car, but seems like a good choice for that meal you wish you had the time or money for but just can't squeeze into the day<br /><br />3) Fairly healthy choice, whole grain pasta that actually tastes pretty good, and a tomato sauce rather than a dairy based which makes it a better choice<br /><br />4) portion size - I added this as a side to a breaded baked Italian chicken dinner.  It added a nice flavor and served the two of us well as the side.  If this were to be my entire meal I imagine this would feed one, as a side dish it feeds two.<br /><br />5) I don't know what the real price is for these, I would consider them to be valued at two to three dollars each.<br /><br />6) As far as the overall flavor, I found the sauce to be a little sweet for my taste, but for the convenience I could put up with the overly sweet sauce.<br /><br />I think that if the price is right, these are an excellent choice for healthy eating at the office, or at school or any other time that you are lacking on time and options.  I would buy these if they were to come available at the local grocer for a reasonable price.",4,1
"While I like all of the Kashi products I've tried, this one has to be my favorite! With a little fresh fruit, how much more healthy can you get? Great taste with seven grains and sesame! Perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box.",5,1
"The size and shape worried me.  I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold.",5,1

"After discovering the San Pellegrino product line, I did a search and happened upon this particular product. After reading some of the reviews, I was intrigued and just had to try it. Now, having tried it, I don't understand the reviews at all. Perhaps it's just an example of how very different people's taste buds are. But this product, to me, is not the least bit bitter. It is quite sugary (sugar is the second ingredient listed, next to water). It does not taste at all lemony or like orange. To me, it tastes very similar to China Cola, which is primarily vanilla, clove, and licorice. China Cola, tastes very similar to Coke. The only real plus to this product is that it is caffeine free... but... so is China Cola (which is expensive, but cheaper than this product), and caffeine free Coke. It does have a little bit of an aftertaste which tastes like fermented grapes... a little like a wine cooler, and this aftertaste goes away very quickly. Not bad. It is good. But nothing special. If they bottled it state side, and therefore would be much cheaper, I would buy more often. But, all in all... it's a good drink.. ok, not bitter,... very sugary though.",5,1
"It's all personal preference, of course, but I really like the flavor of this tea - all four varieties. The flavored teas are pre-sweetened but only slightly. Definitely not too sweet like some other products. I also like the fact that the sweetened drinks are only 50 calories per serving. Only down side is that the servings are relatively small: 8 ounces of tea plus the additional volume from the melted ice makes for about a 12 ounce serving.",4,1
This is a beautiful and sturdy plant that is very easy to grow.  The problem I had with it the first time around was the frost that hit California during Winter.  I failed to cover my plant and it died.  So I have purchased more seeds and am starting again.

They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.",5,1
"I cannot get past the written description of this item. It sounds as though it were written by a 10-year-old. Yes, that does influence my decision to purchase, and No I will not.  Are the White Airheads ""strawberry flavored""? Or of a ""variety of flavors""? Or of a ""scrumptious flavor that you can't quite put a finger on""?

"I like a dark roast and a good strong cup of coffee.  Big Easy Bold delivers.<br /><br />After finding so many of the K-cup varieties to be too weak, I went the My K-cup route for a while.  Part of the joy of owning a Keurig, though, is not having to deal with the mess and clean-up of loose coffee grounds.<br /><br />Diedrich's French Roast and Newman's Own are also excellent, but this one is just one tick darker that makes all the difference for me.",5,1
"This is my favorite soup and I really wish Heinz would make their soups available here in their homeland in the US.  This is staple part of the British diet, along with Heinz Baked Beans and Heinz Vegetable soup among others.  They are all delicious and it gives me a taste of home every so often when I can afford to buy them here.  Thanks Amazon, for making them available.  Try them and you will find they are delicious.",5,1
My Danes love these rawhide rings. The nylon bone it goes into is their favorite.<br />Large size is hard to find locally. Glad Amazon carries them.,5,1
Excellent.  McCann's does it right.  It takes a little longer to cook but the difference is in the taste.  McCann's has a rich nutty taste and is full of nutrition.  I highly recommend it!,5,1
"This tea came in a brown, foil lined, resealable bag and had a proper green color to the tightly rolled balls of tea.<br />It makes a very nice cup of gunpowder tea and I would buy it again.<br />I especially liked that it was organic, since I have read that testing on various non-organic green teas had shown contamination.",5,1
"This is a fabulous healthy snack. 120 cals, 1 fat, 3 fiber and 6 protein for 1/2 cup serving. 2 points per servicing on Weight Watchers. I like them because hot curbs my appetite and they are super crunchy. Some people dont like the crunch I eat them kinda like popcorn or potato chips as a healthy snack. Available in 4.4 oz bag or 5lb bag. Go with subscribe and save and save money!!! You will not find them cheaper any where other than Amazon.",5,1
"This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry.",2,0
"Cooking for myself is pretty much non-existent.  I usually pick up take-out in my neighborhood.  It is easy and so convenient.  So when a friend of mine gave me a sample of Indian spices to try at home, I just threw the package on the counter-top and forgot about it.  But one night, I got home from work after midnight.  Chances of scoring take-out was impossible.  Searching my fridge for anything to eat, I found only some leftover vegetables.  What to do?  Sleep or reheat?  Dreading the boring taste to follow, I noticed the packet from Indian Spice.  Moments after tossing in the spices, a nice aroma filled my kitchen.  My mouth began to water as I waited for the vegetables to warm.  The first taste sent my taste buds spinning.  The meal was fantastic.  Within minutes I had eaten everything, a very uncommon experience.  The following day I bought more packets of Indian Spices.  Thanks for waking me up. What a terrific product!",5,1
"I have tried box after bag of GF pasta.  Today I thew the others away.  This is so far above all the others on the market, they should just close their doors and go home.  Really... I'm serious.  It's all over.  I made linquini and clams with this and WOW - I could serve this in a high-end restaurant and no one would know.  Stop 'trying' all the others - this is it.",5,1
"My young Keeshond puppy is a master of the Tug-a-Jug, but even my 10 year old Border Collie loves the thing!  She will play with it until every last bit of kibble is liberated.  After many hours of play, the jug is a bit scratched, but the rope remains intact.  My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.  Tug-a-Jug is definitely a hit!  It keeps my very busy puppy occupied for 45-60 minutes per refill.",5,1
"Whole peppercorns are a great addition to some gourmet dishes, so when we found this smoked pepper, we decided to try it. It definitely has a pronounced smoke scent and flavor, making it a great addition to smoked meats or pasta served with aouthwest vegetables. There is wnough pepper in the container to allow for a number of uses, and we loaded a grinder with some to experiment with all the ways we could add flavor to brisket, ribs, pasta and seafood. If you are an adventurous cook, or just like different flavors in your cooking, try this. I don;t think you will be disappointed.",5,1
"These were tasty cookies. Tart and just a little sweet. Part of the purchase goes to charity, so I'm sure that cancels the calories!",4,1
"As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints. I usually feel the pain the next day after officiating these two sports. I've been using Calm for approximately four weeks and since I've started I have no soreness, my joints and bones feel good and my muscles are very relaxed. It does have a ""good"" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.",5,1

"I usually just don't have the time to write reviews, but wanted to write something because these excellent tortillas have gotten some bad reviews. I don't know what they are talking about. They taste great. They smell great. They have no added preservatives. They are perfect. They do have a strong tortilla smell, but that is the way they are supposed to smell. They are fresh. That is what fresh tortillas smell like when they aren't loaded down with added ingredients. We fry them lightly to soften them up for use as tacos and they are great.",5,1

"I like brewing loose tea and enjoy Davidson's loose rooibos tea but these tea bags are handy for when I don't have time to fuss or when I want to make some iced tea to keep in the refrigerator. Very nice flavor ~ not weak. I like to put a couple seeds from a cardamom pod in either iced or hot tea. It gives it a nice, chai-like flavor.",5,1
"Great shot in a dirty chai, use in handpresso, handy, portable, consistent shot of joe!",5,1
"Love this product. It tastes almost as good as red bull but with fewer calories. It is healthy, has no artificial sweetners, and the can is bigger than red bull. Did I mention that is has fewer calories? Almost half and without toxic sweetners. One can is about 80 mg. of caffeine, but with green tea which is good for you. It gives me my guilt free caffeine fix. It is a bit pricey, so buy it in bulk.",5,1
"Some good points...these are great if you're conscious of your sugar intake...they should't spike you. The taste is better than I was warned they'd be, very similar to dehydrated apples but a milder slightly off taste that takes a couple to get used to, meaning if you have a handful the first few bites are a little strange, not sure how kids would handle them, but that 'off' taste sort of goes away after that and you're left with good texture and a little  light tangy sweetness. The bad...do not have more than a small handful of these at a time unless you enjoy feeling like your intestines are unraveling and exploding through your tummehhh!! The inulin in these can be a double edged sword if you aren't used to it....prebiotics yes but stomach aches NOOOOOO not a fan. I liked the idea the other reviewer left about using it to sweeten tea...this works well... then eat the piece when you are done with the tea. I've read that mixing pre and probiotics is a good way to go and this is an easy way to add some to your diet.<br /><br />In summary use caution but use often as they are good..in smaller quantities.",4,1

On Sale it is 1/2 the price of the local stores.<br /><br />Thank you.",5,1

"I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage.",1,0
"These vanilla beans arrived in a vacuum sealed package.  I had never purchased vanilla beans before and I was surprised by the scent.  So far, I have used one bean for vanilla custard, and five beans in two small bottles of vanilla extract.  Using a kitchen foodsaver, I vacuum packed my remaining beans in 2s and 3s for future use.",5,1
"I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.",5,1

"I prefer using dried beans as opposed to canned for various reasons. These chickpeas are an excellent product; I would definitely recommend them. Remember that the chickpeas will double in size after soaking, so, although six one-pound bags may not look like much, you will end up with plenty once they have finished soaking. I have used these to make falafel and sundried tomato hummus, and they worked beautifully.",5,1

We live fifty miles from anywhere so the convenience of mail delivery is worth it for us.",5,1

"I bought Zuke's mini treats in Salmon (and then in peanut butter) to re-enforce good walking behavior for my Australian Cattle Dog, Leo.  I liked the fact that they had no added chemicals and were only 2 calories each. They are similar in texture to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D2578G"">Pup-Peroni Original Beef Recipe, 5.6-Ounces (Pack of 4)</a>, but they do not contain by-products, corn syrup, onion powder (onions are toxic to dogs), or nitrates like Pup-Peroni does.  They are cut to a good size--like a pencil's eraser-- a dog does not need to eat a whole stick for a treat-- 2 seconds of flavor is 2 seconds whether its a mini treat or a stick swallowed whole.  They do dry a little over time, but that's because they keep the preservatives to a minimum.  Leo definitely does not seem to mind the texture change, and they retain the very strong salmon smell Leo loves.<br /><br />I do, however, have one caveat for dog parents who plan to give these as training treats. For Leo, the salmon minis are what the trainers on TV call ""high value"" treats. It took 2 weeks for me to use them on walks at all because they made Leo too excited to walk!  When I opened our first bag, the scent hit his nostrils in the next room and he came running to me in the kitchen, as if I were cooking fish or s roast. I made the mistake of saying, ""I think the mail man brought a present for Leo,"" and he immediately started running through his entire repertoire--small though it is. He tried to sit, lie down, sit, shake with the normal paw, shake with the other paw, lie down again, sit again--you get the picture.  I actually had to spend 2 weeks training him how to calm down enough to receive this treat! I still cannot let him use his teeth to take the treat because he is too excited and will inadvertently nip my fingers or the skin of my palm--I trained him to take it with his tongue.  He thinks the peanut butter are wonderful, but he does not become apoplectic for them.  I use the peanut butter for walking treats--he loves them enough to walk properly, even when it's raining.  I save the salmon for dessert and to motivate him to stay calm in difficult situations, like bath day.",5,1
"my dog ( a toy poodle) whos likes people food better than dog food, loves this stuff.... it has no corn products....which is a plus. And she has more energy now too which is great..... i ushually avoid stuff by purina but they have the formula right with this one.....i recomend it",5,1

"I like this tea very much.  It has a soft, quiet flavour - exactly what I want at times when I reach for this tea over other, more dramatic teas.  I'm also enchanted by the tightly wrapped full tea leaves as they unfurl in the hot water, a visual as well as olfactory pleasure.",5,1
"Over the years, I've tried a variety of limited edition Pop-Tarts: ones for Star Wars, ones for Spider-Man, ones for The Simpsons, etc. In honor of Team USA and their competitions in the 2012 Olympics, Kellog's has issued these 2012 TEAM USE OLYMPIA LIMITED EDITION POP-TARTS. I have to say, these are the best limited edition Pop-Tarts I have eaten. I find the wild berry flavor quite scrumptious. The Pop-Tarts have been designed in red, white, and blue colors. The crust is a dark-pink, the sprinkles are red and blue, the icing is white, and the jelly is red. These Pop-Tarts are full of flavor and make a tasty snack.",5,1

"These are exactly the same Graham Crackers Nabisco sells in the traditional rectangular form, but cut in half. The smaller pack size is nice if you use them slowly as there is less chance for the unused crackers to get stall and soft. Other than that, they are just like the originals. I wouldn't pay more per ounce for these than for the traditional ones unless you frequently end up with stale, soggy graham crackers due to slow use rates.",4,1
"So while this product may be for men, I think a woman could use it as well.  I loved the exfoliating beads that were in this body wash.  The exfoliating beads help make you feel nice and fresh.  The scent isn't overwhelming, you don't feel like you have been doused with a scent when you use this body wash.  I really think this body wash can be used by everyone in the house.  In fact, I have enjoyed this body wash far more than many other body washes I have used in the past.",5,1

"I love this product. My mom is in a nursing home, and I think I may have gotten scabies there. Anyway, I had quite a rash, and did not know at the time this was it. I tried medicated powders, diaper rash cream - thinking it may be heat rash. One night the itch was so bad, I decided to put coconut oil on it. Wow- the itch stopped and I slept through the night. Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container. However, I read this plastic is the safe kind. BUt it still makes me a bit concerned.....",4,1

"I normally enjoy my coffee with a little bit of a kick to it.  I'm a fan of strong coffee that slaps you around and wakes you up in the morning.  Marley's One Love Organic Coffee, though, was a nice change of pace for me.  It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.  I actually enjoyed just sitting down on a lazy afternoon to watch the world fly by for a few minutes while drinking this coffee.  I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.  If you're in no hurry, this is a great brew to spend a little time with.<br /><br />Recommended.",4,1
"I thought these were worth a try, and in fact I was a little surprised that over the course of a few days, they do indeed seem to work.  The taste is good too, with some sweetness from the liquorice and even a pleasant hint of curry (I think from the fenugreek), which is better than it sounds.<br /><br />They lose a star because, like many companies, they seem to insist on pointless strings and tags stapled onto the bags.  I prefer to just take teabags out with a spoon, then I can squeeze them against the side of the cup.  All the tag does is increase the chance of getting cardboard in your tea if you forget to hold the tag, and make you faff about removing a staple before you can compost them.",4,1
This wine has a great flavor. It is easy to make. The labels and seals make it look like it was professionally packaged. I did add oak chips during fermentation.,5,1
"The headline says it all: This flavor of Nong Shim soup smells like cat food. I don't know whether it tastes like cat food, because I've never tasted cat food. But the overwhelming similarity in odor makes this soup very difficult to swallow.<br /><br />Don't take this as a negative review of the brand as a whole: I've eaten a lot of Nong Shim noodle bowls, and I generally like them. The spicy chicken is probably my all-time favorite powdered soup. It's a good way of getting reasonably full reasonably fast for very little money -- and the spiciness can help you drink a lot of water if you need to. The packages are designed so you can use boiling water or a microwave, and the individual bowls are sealed. All in all, a good line of products -- but this flavor stinks.<br /><br />Nong Shim makes a lot of flavors. Pick a different one.",1,0
"I was skeptical about this rice, especially because I've had other Annie Chun's products that weren't good at all. Based on the reviews here, I picked up a bowl and tried it. The rice is very, very good. Moist and sticky, just like it should be.",5,1
"Ordered in Oct, delivered on a day in the 70s, but chocolate had the white spots that seems to mean that the oil was migrating out of the chocolate. That means they were a bit old and/or got warm in the warehouse. Not exactly stale, but not that impressive. The dark chocolate was okay, but did not have that ""intense"" dark chocolate flavor. Will not order this again.",2,0

"This is a great tea if you like Rooibos. It tastes great, the color is great, and they give you a ton of it for a low price.<br /><br />The two main complaints I've read about this tea is 1) packaging and 2) the tea is cut too fine.<br /><br />1) The tea came in a nice resealable package, not the one shown, but covered in the same plain brown paper bag-like finish.<br /><br />2) When I first opened the bag and for about a month or two I noticed no sediment at all. Once I got down into the bottom portion of the tea and started mixing it up I noticed sediment. If you are worried about having no bits of anything in your tea, this could be a problem. They are tiny small fibrous strands that you don't notice at all when drinking.<br /><br />Otherwise, the tea tastes great and you can brew it for as long as you want for desired strength (recommended 3-7 minutes).",5,1
"I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.

Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!",5,1
"I like the convenience of my Krueg, but was not happy with those all plastic cups.  I also didn't want the mess of filling the cup that came with my machine.  I tried many brands...all purchased from Amazon.  San Francisco Bay Fogchaser arrived when I had house guests so we compared Fogchaser to some other brands.  First of all I was pleased to see instead of a plastic cup, it was in a little bag with a plastic ring....still plastc but much less.  But the important thing is we all liked the coffee better then the other brands.  I am on my second order.  I am trying to determine how much we use so I can place an automatic order.",4,1
This salt is just as it states smooth with a buttery feel. very potent also would recommend to anyone. it is just a delight on any food,5,1
Very good coffee.  Not too strong. These K-cups are an excellent way to make one cup of coffee.,4,1
"My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these.",5,1
"These are perfict for a night out at the bar with friends, they are perfictly dry not over moist.<br /><br />Stick 1 in your cheek and even the $1. Happyhour beers go down smooth",5,1
"This cereal is so good and good for you.  Low cal, lots of fiber.  I have it every morning with 8 raisins and a few sliced almonds and skim milk.",5,1
"My husband will drink nothing but double bergamot earl grey from Stash, I used to by it straight from Stash but this is much faster and still a good price! I will probably set up a autoship order as soon as I figure out how fast we go through 6 boxes.  If you like Earl Grey, you really need to try this tea! They also have a green tea version",5,1
This is such a great price on this cereal. I was paying $1 every day from Target or from our cafeteria at work for these.  These are great to pop in my purse and not have to worry with a container to take home. love it!,5,1
Excellent!  Very happy with the product.  I am a big tea drinker and definitely love this tea brand.  Will order this classic tea again.,5,1
"This tea is extraordinarily delicious but I didn't notice until I took a closer look at the label that the inrgedients do include  milk and soy products.  I know other vegans or folks who suffer with dairy or soy allergies would appreciate knowing this because I don't think it is mentioned in the product information. If it is, I missed it.<br /><br />In spite of that oversight, I am not going to lower my rating of this tea.  It really is exquisite and I will be delighted to serve it to guests even though I shouldn't indulge in it myself.  (But I probably will indulge anyway because it is so very good and I am weak!)<br /><br />The ingredients as stated on the label: rooibos, apple pieces, vanilla chips, 100% organic peppermint, chocolate & natural vanilla flavor (Contains milk and soy products)",5,1
"I just tried your Coco libre coconut water and I must say that it was the best of the best.<br />I have tasted it most of the others and this one was really tasty, refreshing.<br />May be because its Organic, icing on the cake.<br />My family and I enjoied it very much, I even take it to the gym classes now; thank you for carrying it:)<br /><br />H",5,1
"I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.5 ounce cans for my cats at the local mom and pop pet supply store.  It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent ""other"" vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving.",5,1
"I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!",4,1
"I have a 6 month lab/ husky mix that no joke-- INHALED his food in ten seconds.. Today when I put his food in the tug a jug... it took him a whole 30 minutes to get a cup and a half of food out! Mornings are usually rough for us-- dog wants to eat, is bored, full of energy. Then we are trying to get ourselves/ kids fed, cleaned up etc. The fact it gave him something to do.. kept us from getting frustrated trying to manage all our morning responsibilities. I am sure over time he will better figure it out... but they have ways to make it more tricky.. ex: bigger treats.. etc.<br /><br />I have spent so much money on this dog.. on toys.. treats etc.. everything to try to make our lives eaiser. This is my fave so far!",5,1
A few of my friends told me how much their cats loved this stuff so I decided to try it for my kitty. He goes nuts for it! I give it to him as a treat and crumble it on top of his canned food when he gets finicky. There's never one crumb left in his dish! Great stuff!,5,1
Sent it as a christmas gift and was told the kids loved it. Better then flowers or fruit basket when it's for a family with young kids.,5,1
"If you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you. It's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners. I love it and I know my body loves it. NO digestion problems, ever. Rock on.",5,1
"I try all of our daughter's food before I give it to her, because I refuse to feed her something that I wouldn't ever consider eating myself.  I like all of the Ella's products, however this is one of my daughter's favorites!  Like the other products mixed with baby rice (brown rice, mind you), it is thicker in its consistency and might need to be watered down with a bit of breastmilk or formula (or water) for younger babies. I definitely wouldn't start with this; I'd try one of the ones that's primarily apples, pears, mangoes, etc.",5,1
"This is the best sugar you can buy!  The taste is earthy, the aroma of molasses.  When you make a 1 to 1 by volume sugar syrup, it will have the color of coffee!",5,1
These chips are the best chips ever. They are thick and crispy. No chip compares.<br />These chips are gluten free. And should be considered a gluten free grocery. Ordering by the case really saves money compared to grocery store.,5,1
"I own a shih tzu that hardly eats anything, and as far as treats go will only eat Happy Hips and (groan!)- Snausages!  Unbelievable!  He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.",5,1
See's Peanut Brittle is the best you can buy.  Just wish there were more See's stores so I wouldn't have to pay shipping.,5,1
Creme de la creme of sea salt. Great taste and I love the color!<br />Perfect size granules to use for a table or cooking salt.,5,1
"Krave Double Chocolate Cereal is all right.  I love chocolate, so I thought I'd give this cereal a try.  I found it tastes artificial, but still enough like chocolate for me to enjoy.  I like eating cereal dry, so I didn't get the effect of the milk turning into chocolate milk (although, I think this is a great idea for those that enjoy milk).  I liked the texture too, which was like other bran cereals.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, which is particular to me, is that this cereal contains corn bran.  Corn is one of my migraine triggers, so I was disappointed that I couldn't eat too much of this cereal.",4,1
"I was not sure this product would live up to the ads, but it gave me the energy boost I needed when I needed it when I had to work the overnight shift.",5,1
"I purchased this coffee for my office machine and immediately started getting complaints. When I tried it my self I thought it was some of the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It is tolerable when loaded up with sweetener, however. It tastes like jet fuel mixed with mud.",1,0
I  have bought this tea for years but recently the company changed the product.  They seem to have added too much bergamot and the tea is very unpleasant.,1,0
"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money.",1,0
"These and the Dingo stix are the same thing just about. Great product. Healthy ingredients, no bad preservatives.  A+++++",5,1
"Eden's organic matcha tea is wonderful. It's potent, very fresh, and tastes very ""green"". I like to use it to make green tea smoothies or just brew it hot and froth it with my little bamboo matcha whisk. It's like my jet fuel. I know the little can is pricey, and so I use it sparingly. It's a worthy indulgence, since I know it's so good for me!",5,1
It took me a long time to find some non-sweetened black tea and this produce is great. I don't understand why all tea makers think tea needs to be sweetened.,4,1
It's that good!  Heaven if you like cinnamon.  Tastes sweet with no sugar.,5,1
"These are good bones, and the dogs like them, but they have to stay outside. If you give one to your dog indoors, when the dog is done it will look like a buffalo exploded in the middle of your living room. I've bought other real bones before, which aren't nearly as cheap as these, and never had that problem.",2,0
"Good price... but this is the first time I have ever found hard crunchy chopped up bay leaves in Herbes De Provence seasoning and I have been using it for years! Doesn't make for very good eating... is this just filler? To me, it ruins the whole bottle... they get stuck in your teeth and don't digest... ugh! If you can put up with that... good price... other wise... not very good quality! Sorry!",2,0
I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised.,5,1
"I am completely satisfied with these turkey sticks, as well as the beef sticks.<br />Most sticks leave a greasy smudge in my mouth which is quite revolting but not these.<br />Finally a great protein snack to keep in my desk",5,1
"Did not like the taste of the tea. It tastes a bit like it's been on the shelf for quite a while, hence such a discount maybe? Will not buy again. The box does look a bit cheap, although I bought it for myself, so I didn't care that much. Definitely would not give it as a gift to someone.",1,0
"Never been to cincinnati, but love this product.  We had a local store that was carring this in Washington state.  But they stopped. :(  now we can order it on amazon.<br /><br />People are complaining because it's not like normal chili...  It is it's own new type of food.  Don't compair it to regular chili, try it on it's own.  Enjoy.",5,1
"I love this cereal! I was looking forward to trying it since I like the other varieties of Oatmeal Squares. The Cinnamon has the same great texture and crunch. I thought maybe the cinnamon flavor might be too strong and overpowering, but it's not. It's just right! It is great in a bowl with milk or by the handful right out of the box for a quick snack. Quaker has another winner! I will be buying this again.",5,1
"We love happybaby products, our twins like most of them.  Unfortantely this is nothing like the others.  Very dry, paste like.  Babies refused to eat it.",1,0
"My order arrived on time.  I bought this for friends at work.  It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual.  What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard.",4,1
"If you love chocolate truffles and raspberries, you will love this coffee.  Flavors are not overbearing -- just enough to enhance the coffee.  The aroma while brewing is heavenly.  Enjoy.",5,1
"I have a puppy that absolutely loves them! She considers them her personal ""reward"" for everything she does. A good training aid.",5,1
"Had I not seen her review, I might not have ordered a six pack of this DELICIOUS spread, but I owe her big time!! This spread, jam or whatever you'd like to call it is a MUST for any ginger lover and I've even gotten a tip from my cousin that it can be used to make marinades for meats and poultry too - or in BBQ sauces!<br /><br />GO FOR IT! If you're anything like us, you'll find yourself ordering another 6 pack FAR sooner than you think you would have. It's AWESOME stuff!!",5,1
"I've been using Nestle's Fat Free Hot Cocoa Mix in the small envelopes for years and loved it.  When my store discontinued it, I searched on line and discovered I could get it in the canisters at a much lower price.  Only one problem, I use so much more now.",5,1
"I prepared as instructed, but the taste was not pleasing, Very fast food like , a poor taste.<br />Was especially disapointed, as the McDougall Split Pea soup is something I do rather like,",1,0
I love these and can no longer find then in stores so went to amazon and got myself lots so as not to run out in the near future,5,1
Great tasting protein bars.  Best pricing found on Amazon.com.  We were paying over $2 a bar at our local health food store.  Have these on auto-ship.  LOVE that!  Feels like a cheat!,5,1
My favorite gum --- it's been hard to find in retail stores.  Great price!,5,1
I don't live in the USA and you just don't get this sort of quality item here. I love them. Yummy. Watch your teeth. Do not bite these or you might loose them. Suck only :),5,1
"You know when you taste something you loved as a child, and it isn't half as good as you remember it? Mr. Kipling Cherry Bakewells are not like those things. They are forever delicious, forever exceedingly good, just as the package says. Other customers here would like you to skip purchasing these, so that they may have these all to themselves. Well, I am magnanimous. I would like you to try them, but I am hoping you have odd, malfunctioning tastebuds (possessed by demons perhaps) so that you hate them. Then I can freely purchase and eat more, without you standing in my way. Thank you for your time.",5,1
"I ordered 3 bags of these. They came today. Alot of them don't even have any chocolate in them. They are nothing like the old fashioned ones. They are very fruit flavored, hard and lack chocolate. Not a good buy.",1,0
I am just now getting into teas. I have had herbal teas in the past and they all tasted the same (to me) like drinking grass. Yuck! I recently bought this tea and can honestly say that I like it and will buy more. I personally add a little milk and some Stevia sweetener.  I also like the Jasmine tea they make.,5,1
"Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!",5,1
These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar. they don't have that bad chemically tasting sweetness that alot of low sugar foods have.  they only have 200 calories whereas most of the protein bars i've tried have over 300 calories.  i've been trying to lose weight and starting eat one of these bars a day to try and keep myself from eating candy bars. they definitly satisfy my craving for sweets. i've lost 4 lbs in the past few weeks so at least i know they aren't preventing me from losing weight like my daily candy bar fix was.  also the carb amount is fairly low in these bars. i'm hooked on them and will plan to keep buying them in bulk.,5,1
Great potato taste and crunch with so much less fat than regular chips. The order arrived promptly and in good condition.<br />PCH,5,1
"This product is great if you want a dirty martini, I highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine.",4,1
"I used to spend a fortune on good Chai Tea at the coffee shop.  Then, I discovered the double-spice tea.  We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a ""sweetener of choice"" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his ""pre-sleep"" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a ""foil"" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!",5,1
"This is just a plain milo which you need to mix with sugar and cream.  Any of these is good, non dairy cream, condensed milk or fresh milk.  I prefer the taste of condensed milk with it.  The mixture of coco, malt and cream is so yummy...  either steamy hot or with ice.<br />I started to drink hot coco when I moved to US thinking it'll replace milo.  I was so wrong cause I miss it's unique taste.  Too bad I can't find the 3 in 1 pack here.",5,1
"This was a new brand for our Keurig, so I did not know what to expect. I was surprised with no ""k-cup"" - but this works very well and seems ""greener."" Tastes great.",5,1
My husband has Parkinson's Disease which affects many mobility issues including the intestine's ability to move normally. Calm works. He takes 2 teaspoons in 1/2 cup of warm water each morning and that pretty well takes care of his former problem.,5,1
I think  is so by far the best Altoids I always order in bulk because they are hard to find.,5,1
"I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control.  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it.  I read that Ceylon cinnamon was the 'real' thing so I purchased a pound of it last summer and have been using it.  I did not change anything else in my diet.  Two weeks ago I had my six-month check-up and my 3-month levels were WAY down.  We were all quite surprised and although I do get outside and do more work in the summer, which might help a bit, it has not helped to that degree in years past.  I'm thinking it was the cinnamon, which I use quite a bit in cooking and in the breads I make (I make all our own).  Yes, it's got a great taste, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a gourmet when it comes to cinnamon -- I like it in whatever form it comes in!  I am thinking, though, that there really is something to the claims being made for this stuff in terms of blood sugar control.  I'm ordering more now.",5,1
My dog's a chewer and these are his favorite chew snacks.  He loves the little bit of meat wrapped in the center and it keeps him entertained for a good hour as he nibbles away.,5,1
Have not come across this product in any Store and find it very good.<br />My dogs like it and would only have one comment to make it smaller for small dogs instead of one size fits all,5,1
"I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more ""dried out"" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.",2,0
After a long week of projects at work I was exhausted. I had a closing project that needed to be completed and came in on a Saturday to finish the work. Well I needed a pick-me-up and did could not risk feeling the crash later on. So I took a 5-hour energy and sure enough I was ready to go. I love 5-hour energy and I recommend it to anyone who needs some energy.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.,4,1
"Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.",1,0
So it's Chai.  If you don't know Chai is a spiced tea.  In this case the overtone is vanilla.  It's got a little of everything you might get in pumpkin pie spice.  It's very tasty.  I use two scoops in a twice as large glass and I make it just with hot water.  You don't need to add milk.  Many of the local coffee bars actually use this brand.  You could of course make this whole thing yourself but this is a GREAT alternative. And of course Amazon is a great place to get it.  I actually love that they kind of remind me every couple of months to get more because I usually need it.,5,1
"Well, I'm hooked. I mean, I can't stop drinking this stuff. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this tea is not bitter at all, and the kombucha rounds it out in such a way that, well, you start to crave it. Maybe a lot of it. Maybe that's OK...<br /><br />I just broke down and bought a 6-pack of this from Amazon, as I've been spending waaay too much on it at my local grocer's.<br /><br />I drink this two cups at a time. I'll be on my 3rd and 4th cups for the day in just a moment. I'm boiling water right now. Pathetic, ain't it?",5,1
"My children were diagnosed Celiac 3.5 years ago and the search began.  I have made bread from scratch, bought different mixes (Bob's Red Mill and more) and just couldn't find one that smelled or tasted good.  This is the one!  My kids LOVE IT!!!  They want to eat it as soon as it is coming out of the machine.  Very easy to make and it doesn't last long in the house before they are asking me to make another loaf.  Thank you PAMELA!!!  They take it to school and have a sandwich like all of their friends again.  LOVE LOVE this product.  AND her Pancake mix is great as well.  We use that for pancakes and anything that calls for flour.",5,1
"I've been buying antlers from Chasing Our Tails for a while now and never had a problem with the size -- that is, until now. I purchased a 5-7 inch antler and the one I received was like 4 inches. And darker than the other ones. My puggle chewed it down in two days. I'm disappointed of the size and quality of the one I just received. I'm going to buy another one -- 7-10 inch -- and if the quality is the same and small I will not buy from Chasing Our Tails Again. They're expensive.",1,0
"I purchased this Lavendar for my daughter's BumbleBee themed baby shower to make Lavender Honey Scones. Which I did, and they were a huge success, there were no leftovers! But then I got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes. Our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill. Yum!",5,1
"Being addicted to Senseo Vienna Waltz Hazelnut Coffee, I've been desperate to find a replacement since Sara Lee decided not to continue making it.  I was delighted to find Baronet Hazelnut Medium Roast on Amazon and ordered some immediately.  The first cup I made was the most bitter coffee I'd tasted in years.  I made another cup today using the 2-pod holder and the coffee was less bitter, but definitely doesn't taste nearly as good as Senseo.  I'm hoping they'll bring back Senseo Vienna soon so I won't have to give up drinking coffee!",1,0
"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!",4,1
"I am on my third child and making baby food for the first time.  For some reason it is the thing to do these days.  :)  If someone had suggested it to me the first two times around I would have thought them to be crazy--who has time for that?!  But honestly, the Brezza takes no time at all.  I am astonished by how simple and fast it is.<br /><br />I choose the Brezza over the Baeba one because you don't need to change the containers in between steps and have two bowls to wash.<br /><br />My only tiny complaint is that I have trouble coaxing the blade out. The first day I sliced my hand twice trying to get it out.  The first time was my fault (I stupidly grabbed the blade) but the second time it jolted out after  I had been pulling on it with great effort.  I have been using it for over a month now and make my husband remove it out of fear of cutting my hands again.  Still can't figure out the ""trick"" as I am sure there is one.",4,1

"Tabasco Habanero is similar to regular Tabasco sauce, but more picante. If you haven't tried it, you should try a smaller bottle first before committing yourself to a gallon of the stuff. See, for example, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNC8VW"">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce 5oz.</a><br /><br />As others have noted, you'll want to have a funnel and a smaller bottle to transfer the sauce into for daily use. I have one at home and another at the office.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that the one gallon jug lacks pinache. A plastic cap? Customers loyal enough to buy this thing probably want to show it off, but to my eye, this jug looks cheap.",5,1
"I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.<br /><br />The small package size is very nice for diet-conscious snackers, although I will say that I wish it were a little bit easier to open. But maybe the thickness of the packaging and the tight seal at the top is to keep in the freshness better.<br /><br />The price point isn't bad, although I can get chips cheaper in larger bags at local grocery stores.<br /><br />Overall, a very good snack product in a very convenient size.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flower, flax seeds, turbinado can sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz.

"Some tastes stay with you.  In this case, from the time I first had them as a child.  Exciting and wildly flavored?  No, you're after something else.  Straightforward, doesn't melt in your hand, but has a flavor locked in it that you can get to?  Much closer.  This is candy for keeping and for savoring out of the ordinary.",5,1
The name of these biscuits speaks for itself. They are great first thing in the morning with or without tea/cofee and after meals.,5,1
This bully stick is so small!! It's really light. No substance. I returned it immediately. For the price you can purchase at least two smaller bully sticks that will be thicker. My dog would devour this thing in minutes! Do not purchase.,1,0
"Many men my age have a retreating hairline.  Mine didn't just retreat, it unconditionally surrendered!..many years ago...and left only a few lonely sentinels on the great plain of my balding pate. What hair I have left is a semi-circular rear-guard on the back of my head and above my ears.  And it's sensitive.  After a defeat like that, who wouldn't be?<br /><br />In fact it's so sensitive that the usual dandruff-removing shampoos (the kind that's supposed to make your scalp ""tingle"" when it's working) irritate my skin so badly that it turns red...or maybe it's just blushing after its former defeat.  So I quit using dandruff shampoos...and quit wearing dark shirts and coats as a result.<br /><br />Along comes CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY. I thought: what the heck, why not try it.  The worse that can happen is nothing...or my skin turns the color of fall leaves in the mountains again.<br /><br />It's been less than 2 weeks since I started using CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY and already I've noticed a tremendous difference.  It works.  Not only does it work, it does so without irritating my skin.  Two weeks and no rash or itching...and NO dandruff.  YUP...this stuff works.  It REALLY works.  I like it.",5,1
These do not taste the same as the one's I buy from supermarkets. The tea covers are cheap paper compared to the ones I buy else where. It tastes really weak too. I ordered six packs but will not order tea from internet again unless I read some good reviews.,2,0
I really like this coffee. I use a lot of it. It is very strong on flavor so I mix it half and half with regular decaf coffee. It still has a robust flavor & gives off a great smell as it is making. Enjoy,5,1
O.M.G. I am OBSESSED with Pomegranate Bai! It is so refreshing and a great low-cal product to refuel the antioxidants! It is a great drink to get me through my 3-hour classes each night! It is locally-based so I get really excited to see it in other places! I can't get enough of Bai!,5,1

"I sing Eden Orangic's praises whenever I can. Do a little research and you will too. I now see other brands as cans of toxins. Often I see that people are complaining that Eden doesn't offer a wide enough variety of canned foods. It could be larger and as their customer base grows, I'm sure it will be. Meanwhile your imagination is the limit. For example I make the most awesome brownies with these beans. Yes, black bean brownies! No one in my family knows how I make them and they request them all of the time. I take them to family functions and no one is the wiser. Do a net search for a black bean brownies and use Eden's and other natural/organic products. You'll be amazed.",5,1
If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.,4,1
"So, here's the deal. I'm a skeptic, if it sounds to good to be true...it probably is.<br />My mom has a stage II bedsore and while it's not as gross as the other stages, I knew it could get worse. I did lots of online research and kept coming across this 'Manuka Honey'.<br /><br />In the meantime all the hospital had given me for her wound, (sorry for the graphic detail), which is right at the crack of her butt , was a second skin type of material. This stuff has a slight adhesive that is supposed to stick to the skin without tearing it. The thing was that because of the location, it wasn't sticking and the wound was getting worse.<br /><br />Bottom line, this stuff ain't cheap, but it works. For those of you who have had experience with this sort of sore before know it can be a very long process to cure. I am happy to say that after 3 days of usage, I started seeing results! It's been almost 3 weeks now and almost all of the pinkness is gone and moms sore is about 1/4 the size it was before we started using Manuka.<br /><br />As a postscript, I had a cut on my hand and used it for a couple of days...it did the trick.<br />This is the real deal, and for those of you (like me) who care, it's holistic.",5,1
Fabulous flavour without un-natural ingredients! THe chocolate actually tastes good and the creme filling is super! My kids love these cookies and don't even know that they are Good for you.,5,1

"This tea rocks my world.<br />Never in my life have I enjoyed any type of tea.<br />It's too watery. It's funky tasting.<br />You have to add butt loads of sugar or honey just to choke it down to be polite.<br /><br />One day not long ago, a friend of mine convinced me to try Tazo Passion Herbal tea. I have to say I was hesitant, but to be a good friend, I gave in.<br /><br />One sip was all it took and I was pleasantly surprised and forever converted. I didn't have to add any sugary substance to make it tolerable. The flavor is strong enough that it doesn't taste watery. (Please note that the full leaf is not as strong as the filter bags.)<br /><br />It lists hibiscus, lemongrass, rose hips, mango & passion fruit flavors as ingredients. Since I enjoy things on the fruity side, this was perfect. Tazo's site gives this description for it's taste, ""Berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, and earthy dense.""<br /><br />This is now my drink of choice whenever I feel like something besides water. I've used it to soothe sore throats and bad days. It's good on rainy days, snowy days, and if you can stand the heat, sunny days. I haven't tried it iced yet, but I'm sure that'll be a treat!",5,1
I love these!  I get a ton of energy without jitters and never crash; just wears off slowly.  I usually mix these up in bottles and throw them in the freezer a few hours before I'm going to use them.  They form ice much like a slushie and are just fabulous!,5,1
"Having tried and liked a different flavor I decided too try another of these instant flavored drink mixes and was not disappointed. I took a packet out of the box and added it too 16oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. When I took my first sip I was shocked. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Strawberry & Acai Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning. The box list that these are 5 calories per serving, which is eight ounces. But each packet is designed too be used with 16 ounces so is 10 calories. So for two servings (which is what I drink) you are consuming a drink with 20 mg of caffeine, 0g Fat, 0g Sodium, 0g Protein, and 2g each of Sugar and Carbohydrates. The packets are very convenient too carry with you and too use anywhere you can get a glass or bottle of water.",5,1
I am sorry that I purchased SIX boxes of this product.  I made one box and followed the directions for the brownie version.  The finished product was anything but delicious.  The orange taste was on the bitter side and the chocolate cake/brownie was very grainy and crumbly.  The name sounded so good - but it did not live up to it's name and I was very disappointed.  My guests agreed that it just wasn't good.,2,0
I just bought the Emril k-cups and have used about 12 of them and half if them exploded in my kurig machine.

"I have fallen in love with Ghiradelli chocolates over the past six months. About 2 months ago they came out with the Dark Truffle and it's wonderful! They are a nice little (individually wrapped) candy if you just want a little something sweet. They are not over the top rich that makes you (or at least me) feel overwelmed and kinda sick. I definetly recommend this candy, but I would go into a store and get it. Amazon's price is like $6 more than going into Target and buying it. Although Amazon has a great deal on Ghiradelli's Dark Caramel. Maybe the Truffle will come on sale. Enjoy!!",5,1
"Loved the product at first. It was so easy and convenient. However, I noticed that it took forever to grind up things that are little tougher or has a skin like green beans or peas compared to my food processor.<br /><br />Then I read some reviews regarding brown water coming out of the steaming unit. And when I checked my Baby Cook to my surprise found brown stuff on the bottom of the water heating unit. Was able to clean off a little bit but it is not designed to be cleaned easily. Thought the expense was for convenience but if the water reservoir can not be easily kept clean...I have no use for the it. Especially since it doesn't even grind as well as my food processor.<br /><br />Called the company to have it returned today. Hope it won't be a hassle.",1,0
"Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.",2,0
"I have tried several brands of giseng teas.  I find the taste of this Korean tea very pleasant, and no after taste.  I recommend this over others sold on this site.",5,1

"Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.",5,1

Very good. Great in between meal bar. Keeps me from being hungry and has helped me to shed some more weight. Taste great and is easy to carry with me when I am unable to stop and eat a meal.,4,1
These Kind Bars are so good and healthy & gluten free.  My daughter came across them and loves them for a quick snack between her hectic schedule of classes & work. Most times she won't have time to eat a full meal and these are such a great alternative to fast food.  I will order again & this time I'll get a few for moi! Really loved the coconut too..,5,1
"I'm eating these for the first time as I type. (I've written reviews on the double 12-packs of Bowl Noodle, by the way, if you want to know my opinion of Bowl Noodle in general.) Shin Bowl Noodle are every bit Bowl Noodle (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDO2YC"">Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Kimchi, 3.03-Ounce Packages, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a>). This particular flavor's very spicy and oozes the essence of black pepper. All-in-all, this is like gourmet Bowl Noodle. It has more soup base and it's thicker; the vegetables are higher-quality and revive better than those in Bowl Noodle, and are more flavorful. If you're a Nong Shim fan, this is a must-buy! If you like Hot and Spicy Bowl Noodle, especially, or just any Bowl Noodle variety, you're going to like this.",5,1

"I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it.<br /><br />I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well.<br /><br />Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy.",5,1
I really like this stuff and can drink it by the gallon.  No sugar but it tastes sweet.  The only problem for me is the caffine but they have a caffine-free version also.,5,1

This is all I feed my baby. She is a 12 year old Boston Terrior. She has allergies but this is the only food I have found that does not break her out. It is easy to digest and keeps her wieght under control. She likes the taste and it has the great stuff for her skin in it. If your dog is having skin problems I hightly recommend trying this food. It is the BEST!!!,5,1
"I damaged my vocal cords when I was a kid, so I lose my voice often and I am also prone to getting a sore throat VERY often . A friend of mine recommended this tea to me about four years ago and it is incredible!<br /><br />It tastes delicious. I usually let the tea bag steep for 10 or 15 minutes to develop the full flavor. It is soothing and really does ""coat"" your throat so it doesn't burn or scratch or hurt. It is almost like a natural organic anesthetic. I highly recommend it to anyone with a sore throat. Try it once, and you will be a fan for life.",5,1
The best find ever; I love cooking with this salt.  Great deal- have purchased this product twice and not disappointed!,5,1
Easy to blend with electric blender if you want it smoother and often add herbs and other goodies such as smoked ham.  You can create variations with each can instead of a whole pot of soup the same.,5,1
"This coffee smells terrific as it brews.  The flavor is nice but is missing any distinctive hazalnut flavor.  If it's the taste your after, order something different.  If it's the scent you like but are not a big hazelnut fan, this might be your brew.",2,0

I get no upset stomach and I still get great workouts.",5,1
"It is convenient and cost-effective to purchase Kellogg's K by way of Amazon.  However, this product is not available as frequently as I would like.  There are so many ""K's"" with additives that I don't want.",5,1

"This is the fourth item from ""Tiptree"" that I've tried.  (Their ""Little Scarlett Strawberry"" is out of this world!  The regular ""Strawberry"" and ""Damson"" (plum) were also very good.)  Truth be told, I found myself a bit surprised at first taste; being it's somewhat bitter.<br />Aside from random U.S. marmalade's; I have tried one of ""Mrs. Bridges""- a Scottish (orange) marmalade, of which, there was no bitterness.<br /><br />The previous reviewer said this one from ""Tiptree"" is made from ""Seville"" oranges; which neither the website nor my jar indicates.<br />However, I just read some info on ""Seville"" oranges, and they are supposed to be bitter (they come from the Mediterranean).  One page stated that no ""pectin"" is required.  Since this particular one does not contain ""pectin"" (as some other marmalade's of ""Tiptree"" do), this could very well be made from Seville's.<br />FYI, The label also states: ""45 grams of fruit per 100 grams"".<br /><br />With that said, after a few times of eating it now, I'm quite used it's unique flavor, and find it delicious on toast!<br />  For those who aren't keen on a slightly bitter spread, perhaps you should steer clear of at least this particular blend/flavor from ""Tiptree"".  (P.S. I just read a review on their ""Tawny"" (orange; thick cut), which said it's also bitter.)<br /><br />In conclusion, I hope to try another of their marmalade's in the near future!",5,1
My dog absolutely enjoyed these cookies every time I gave her one! I would recommend buying that for your animals because they are healthy!,5,1

"Having committed to a weight loss plan, I have relied more frequently on healthy smoothies and protein shakes as a quick and easy way to stick to the diet plan. The Bell Plantation PB2 powder has made me look forward to drinking the shakes - absolutely amazing! Before, I just gulped the shake down like it was bad medicine. Now, I can see that it is a factor in sticking to the plan - healthy choices can be quite tasty and delicious.",5,1
My 10 month old Choco lab is chewing everything she can. She gets a dog rope or any other toy and chews it to pieces in a day at most. I've had 3 of these bones a month now and two are still with us! She loses them and hides them on herself but she can chew for a good hour at a time and they keep her happy. These are a great product for a great price!,5,1
Great source of carbs and good for the circulatory system.  Being pure buckwheat they will clump together until you rinse them.  I think they are much better this way for variety if you have the unrelated traditional wheat already in your diet elsewhere.  I always eat these plain right after cooking and rinsing them and I could not be happier.,5,1
The shipping charge was free and the transaction was smooth and quick. the product is fresh and easy to order. will order again and recommend.,5,1
"The box said it came from Paragon in Mo. , but the plastic bag ( not a brown paper bag as shown) said Dynamite Popcorn. I called Paragon up directly and got a recorded message, so I left them a message about it & asked them to call me.

Right now I'm a bit confused but my stomach is happy though.",4,1
"I bought a bottle of this in Tennessee when I was visting the Smoky Mountains.  I've been looking for it everywhere since I ran out.  I love this stuff.  It kinda sounds like it would be weird but it taste like ketchup, just with the flavor kicked up.  Very good.  It is not overly hot.  it was not too hot for my wife.  She doesn't like stuff as hot as I do and she liked it as well.  You can't go wrong with this.  Great on hamburgers or in meatloaf.",5,1

"Here's an item that we like keeping on the kitchen shelves. It's a 13.5 ounce plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Dried and Chopped onions. We usually use fresh onions wherever possible, but these fine-grained chopped onions lend themselves for using in meat balls, meat loaf, soups where the fine grain size is important and in a variety of dips. Nice taste. Easy to store. Long shelf life. Ours is now over the ""best by"" date, but the still work fine and I wouldn't think of throwing them out. It's a good, useful product to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",5,1
"This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.",4,1
"I gave this to the family cat for Christmas this year and he likes it. He's not a very picky eater for a cat, but he turns his nose up at some things occasionally--this food was not one of those things.

"This review is for the Honey Graham sticks.  My son was diagnosed in 2010 with food allergies and I immediately set out to find foods he could enjoy.  It was not easy.  Some foods that don't use corn based sweeteners taste horrible- I am so happy to say that this is not one of those.  These crackers are SO good, we often run out before our next shipment comes.  There are usually 13 sticks in each pack (we've used them in math lessons quite a few times, my son gets quite a kick out of eating his work!), so not a lot, but a nice little snack for a child.  We love them with the JIF peanut butter cups to go or plain.  They are way better than Honeymaid or Keebler grahams!",5,1

"I purchased two of these sets as gifts.  One is going to my sister-in-law who loves tea, but who also is an artist that I think will really be in awe by this set.<br /><br />The care in the packaging of this item was the first thing to impress me. It came in the standard Amazon box, then another cardboard box, then wrapped in a heavy tissue paper and finally the set itself.<br /><br />Once I carefully got through all of the above, I found a very nice bamboo box with a picture of what was inside.  I decided I needed to peek in so that I could see for myself. The box has button like clasps on the side to keep it closed and when opened the teapot is snuggled in with a box of tea surrounded crinkly brown paper.<br /><br />As I said in my review title, I cannot rate the tea that comes with this set, which is why I only give it 4 stars.  Although if you look at the flowering tea sold separately from Numi here on Amazon you can see that it received an average 4 star review. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFS0CA"">Numi Tea Petite Bouquet Sampler Flowering Tea, 4 Count Sampler (Pack of 12)</a>",4,1
"I picked up a package of blue corn taco shells locally but when I went back for more they were discontinued and I couldn't find them anywhere else.

"The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes, the caps were off of the ball. The soft rubber makes it very easy to get them out this way. And they're a little too expensive to be made so poorly.<br /><br />My puppy loves to chew the ball to get any inner treats and food out, but there are better products on the market for that. Very disappointing product.",1,0
"I endorse the opinions of previous reviewers. From time to time I have been served flavorful, enjoyable tea (in restaurants and people's homes), and I have tried long and hard to duplicate that flavor at home. But I never could. I thought I must be doing something wrong -- preparing the tea wrong, steeping it too long, getting stale tea, or something. I could never match that delicious tea flavor I remembered and liked so much.<br /><br />Then I bought some Typhoo tea (at Big Lots -- cheap, but who knows when they'll have it again?). Now I know the fault wasn't mine. It was the fault of the cardboard-tasting tea I had always got in supermarkets before. There isn't a brand of tea in our supermarkets that can match the wonderful taste of this tea.",5,1
"I use artificial sweeteners all the time, and I'll admit I was skeptical about trying this one. However, it surpassed my expectations. It's sweet like table sugar right out of the package and the grains look similar to sugar. I like the texture better than Nutrasweet, Splenda, and Truvia. It dissolved quickly in my iced coffee, which is the main place I use sweeteners. I don't drink hot beverages, so I didn't try it there.<br /><br />I like the taste better than the Splenda and Truvia that I've been using and I thought this had less of an after taste. I made some iced coffees for friends with it and they said they couldn't tell it had an alternative sweetener. I say alternative, because it isn't exactly artificial like some are. Anyone who uses alternative sweeteners knows that there is some sort of after taste to all of them, so it really depends on your taste preferences. This one really scored high for me and I'd definitely buy it again.",5,1
"Outstanding flavor without the bitterness.  Great any time of the day or night.  Can't tell if it's decaf or not.  Wife fools me sometimes and gives me the decaf even when I ask for a cafiene boost.  Great coffee!  Thanks Green Mountain for a wonderful coffee without the American bitterness.  About time someone made a great American coffee to match up to the Italian and French roasts.  Not quite as strong, but almost equally as flavorful.(almost) LOL!",5,1
"I got these puffs and they are wonderful!  My kids don't even want to eat the other brands of puffs anymore!  My kids love the Sweet Potato Puffs because they are crunchy, sweet and always taste fresh!  I love that you get more puffs in this container than any other brand.  I really love the HappyBaby products and think that they are the best!  Even my four and two year old sons love their products!",5,1
"So, I sampled this SWITCH Orange/ Tangerine Blend. Low on the Carbonation, high on the Orange taste, and worth every sip in Gold! Plus, healthy to boot...Give it a try, and you may discard those ""Brand Names"" once and for all!",5,1
My husband is allergic to wheat and we have tried many other grain pancake mixes over the years.  They all seemed to leave something to be desired either in flavor or texture.  He was so glad when I discovered  Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix.  It is by far the best we have tried. It taste and cooks like  regular pancakes. Our kids can't tell the difference and my husband enjoys it so much he often requests pancakes for supper!  We also are very impressed with Pamela's Bread Mix.,5,1
"A great full flavored tea...not flavored sawdust or imitation. It's the real deal. Great for colds, flu &/or sinus congestion. This is 100% the real stuff. In the K Cup, it's ready in a minute or less.",5,1
My wife and I use this in a smoothie every morning.  It's fantastic.  Amazon has the best price by far.,5,1
Tea was very fragrant with strong smell of chocolate and mint. Could not have been more pleased.,5,1
"this Markers are great, they smoothly write in fondant, gum paste and even chocolate! they arrived on time and the only reason why they did not get the 5 stars is because they need to be cleaned often while working with chocolate, the tip scrapes the chocolate a bit when you write and if left without cleaning, it won't write.<br />These are great for details on cake pops, they work wonderfully on candy melts.",4,1
"I ADORE this truffle salt. I can't have breakfast without it anymore, eggs just seem dull without it. It's a mild truffle taste, and for people who might be afraid to try it, this is the one. The smell may put you off when you open it, but don't let that stop you, once it hits your food, it turns into a fabulous taste addition to most foods. I love it on meat and vegetables, and it's incredible on burgers. I cant think of anything I wouldn't try it on. It enhances the flavor of anything it's used on.",5,1
"I have never purchased star anise before this order. I am happy to say it is ""illicium verum"" or Chinese Star anise.<br /><br />Please note that Japanese star anise (shikimi/I. anisatum) and (Florida anise/I. floridanum) are known toxic.<br /><br />I gave this product four stars because so many of the pods do not contain seeds. I still throw them in my tea & they give a nice flavor, but my guess is that the flavor would be stronger if the pods still contained the seeds. Still, I am quite happy with this purchase.",4,1
Maitake mushrooms are hard to find. They are also recommended for their anti-cancer value. I decided to try them and I was very happy with their taste. It only takes 30 minutes to get them ready for cooking. They made a wonderful tasting broth for my stir fry. Would purchase again.,5,1
"I needed, nondescript, chocolate gold coins for my pirate party on Halloween night.  These were perfect!  I ordered three times what I actually needed, and so used some as Thank You gifts for people who assisted with the party and the rest made an evening of Poker a lot more interesting.  The shipping is somewhat expensive, but if you order multiple bags in one shipment, it brings the cost per coin down considerably.  However, they are worth the cost!",5,1
THESE TASTE GREAT.. ANOTHER ITEM I BOUGHT FOR AN EX BOYFRIEND NOW SO I ASSUME ALL IS GOOD SINCE I DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT.,4,1
"These Clusters remind me a lot of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P4H57Q"">Cracker Jacks</a>. Do they still make them? Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip.  They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa.  How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?",5,1
"The coffee is very good, and buying from amazon was by far the best deal I found.  I had read a few reviews that suggested people had problems with the cups not working properly during the brewing process, but I haven't experienced that.<br /><br />I would suggest this product if you are looking for an economical cup of coffee that also has a good flavor.",4,1
These arrived completely uneatable. Maybe they got wet or maybe they melted somewhere but I threw them out. I would suggest not ordering these in the summer.,1,0
"Does not taste like any honey mustard I have tried before.  I wanted my own supply of these handy little pre-packaged servings, and I picked the one with ingredients similar to good stuff I have had from restaurants.  Well, this one tastes nasty.  Hardly any honey or mustard flavor.  It just tastes like sugar and vinegar.",1,0

"I was a little reluctant to try this dressing when my best friend suggested it some time ago. However, once I tried it, I was hooked! I originally tried the regular and decided to also try the light. I was surprised that the light still had a great flavor and it did not taste ""fake"". Now, this is the only dressing I use at home! Thumbs up to Kraft for this one!",5,1
"This is my second order of bb.jerky and although I didnt like my first order of the big slab jerky,I am glad I tried the premium style jerky,it has good flavor and a tender chew,once again the shipping was very fast,and even though my first order was an expensive lesson, bb.jerky has a good variety of products to choose from,so choose wisely,start small and try them all.",4,1
"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.",5,1
"This brownies isn't fudge, it's more like cake. Not sugary, large amount of chocolate powder and chips, awesome! I really love it. For me, I prefer eat this brownies than the fudge one.",5,1
"I was surprised at the all around taste and texture for a brand I did not recognize until shopping on Amazon. I've been a regular jerky eater and have been trying the more well known brands too. This is not the big burly (hard to eat IMO) dinosaur jerky you can buy from Co**** It is smaller, chews well and has a medium taste. It is slightly moist when first opened and this imparts an easy chew. I also like to leave the bag slightly unsealed to ""dry out"" the jerky a little more. This also gives it a unique taste. Great product and a great price so I am subscribing to have it shipped regularly at an even lower price. Enjoy.",5,1

"unless i'm missing something, i think i could get these at my local super market for $2.50 / bag ($7.50 total saving ~10 dollars).",2,0
"I made brightly-colored cupcakes with these, using only a couple of drops - you don't need to use a lot to achieve a bright color. My only complaint is that they don't come with a guide laying out how many drops of what color combination are needed to achieve a specific new color. Other than that, they are definitely worth it and much better than the cheap ones you find at the grocery store.",4,1
These taste great but aren't even as spicy as something that would be labeled jalapeno. I will still buy these but if you are expecting spicy don't be surprised for mild.,4,1
"To be honest, I've only tried one other gluten-free pancake mix besides this one (Arrowhead Mills); but now that I've found G-F Mama, I can't imagine finding a better one!  Compared with the AM (which is still good), the texture is more smooth (being that AM contains cornmeal), and it seems to be easier to flip over than AM too.  Instead of regular milk, I add Bulgarian buttermilk- which adds a special richness!  (And I sometimes add some maple flavoring, or frozen blueberries to the batter as well.)<br /><br />As a side note, I also highly recommend the Coconut Flour Blend- which is delicious!  (We've made cake, sweet bread, and even use it to coat our (fried) chicken pieces.)<br /><br />  I just recently bought the cookie, pizza, and pie crust mixes; but I haven't been able to try them out as of yet.  ..I'm happy to see that Amazon is carrying this brand!",5,1

"I bought these for my chihuahua/dachshund mix.  They are a little large for him, but not too large for him to sink his teeth into.  These keep him busy for hours on end!  They are also a good size for my 13 year old Rottie/Lab mix.  Great value........especially with subscribe and save.  Very happy with this product.",5,1

"This is a great Muesli.  Compare the ingredients and lack of sugar to what is on the store shelves in boxes.  The Amazon price is outstanding.  Here is our secret recipe: cook in just enough water to soften, stir in heavy cream, add a little honey.  It is filling and is a good glycemic index source of complex carbs (and fiber).",5,1
"Moist and a bit sweet.  It is NOT tough and leathery, and has a nice chew to it.<br /><br />Beats all others hands down, and I've tried many.  And I used to make my own jerky, but I like this so much better.<br /><br />Hope the price stays right @ 3/4 lb. for around $8.50 - $9.00.",5,1
"I originally bought these for my Sheltie puppy for the reason given - as pill pockets. He loves them so much - and so does my vet - that I now use them all the time as his treats. I am visiting my sons who also have Shelties - it's very cute to see them lining up, sitting and being very good and quiet just so they can have their Pill Pocket of the day. And of course Amazon has the best prices around, best service and best shipping of anybody else online.",5,1
"Haribo gummies came up under a search for ""vegetarian."" They have gelatin in them, and so they are not vegetarian.",1,0
"I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available.",5,1
This is the first and only hawaiian salt Ive ever tried cooking with so I gave it 4 stars because I dont have anything to compare it with. It was absolutely delicious though. I used it on some pork shoulder with liquid smoke and put it in the slow cooker for 20 hours. It came out amazing. Cant wait to try this on different recipes,4,1
"Great for at-work snacking. The 9-pack fits right in your desk drawer within easy reach! I was surprised at how good these tasted. Great flavor; good bite, not too greasy, not too spicy. The smoky meaty flavor is fun to sink your teeth into, and definitely cures those missed-lunch hunger pangs. Only bad thing (at least for me), is that I would love to eat about three of them in one sitting. Three is approximately half of your RDA fat intake for the day, so snack wisely, my friends.<br />Overall, great taste, good value!",5,1

"I bought this service with the hopes that Ms. Deen herself or at least one of her employees would come out to my house and offer the service indicated in the title, a ""Butt massage"". No, I don't expect anything erotic or anything like that before someone makes such an accusation, I simply put have a sore tush and from time to time need someone to massage it so it's not so tender and painful. Now, did I get said service! No! I instead got two 2.77 ounce shakers of spices. Well, I decided that maybe this isn't the butt of some joke and figured maybe the idea was to ""self serve"" if you will, to massage my own behind with the spices. I did this, and I developed a rash the next day! I will NOT order this product again.<br /><br />The spices would probably be okay on pork though. But I don't own any livestock to massage so for me that is moot.<br /><br />As an aside, this is a cut and paste of my review of a different size of Ms. Deen's butt massage service, thus the reference to two 2.77 ounce shakers.  Even so, given the only difference is the size of the jar my comments there should apply to here fine.",1,0
"All I have to say is my husband didn't know that the shortbread cookies I made with this mix were gluten-free. That should say it all!<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Shortbread Cookie Mix is awesome.  This cookie mix has great taste and very easy to make.  Snip the bag, pour into the bowl, add a few other ingredients and they are ready to bake.  Although I did cheat and make them as ""pan cookies,"" they turned out great! They are great with fresh fruit and a little chocolate syrup on top or with ice cream.",5,1

I recieved the 70's bag for my birthday last year.  It was Super Yum - the candy was all fresh just like I remembered it.

"Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.",5,1
"Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted.

"I was surprised at all my local grocery stores at the lack of larger packages of chili powder. All the brick and mortar grocery stores seem to offer just little tiny spice rack bottles of chili, about what is needed to make one nice pot of chili, at exorbitant prices. Buying this chili powder in bulk has been my private little consumer revolt.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on how this chili powder compares to other brands. But I do make no-frills, old-fashioned chili pretty often, and this chili powder has produced good results. Neither too wimpy for me, a spicy food lover, nor too spicy for my wife, who likes things mild. This chili powder, on its own, produces strong flavor without major heat. For a bit more of a kick, I mix in cayenne pepper.<br /><br />Don't let the corner grocery store rob you on chili powder any more. This is two pounds of chili powder. Not recommended for those who don't want to use quite a bit -- but if you do chili often, it's worth it.",5,1

It's like I'm discovering the joys of fresh-cracked pepper for the first time all over again. I can't wait to season some nice thick steaks with this.<br /><br />The flavor is very bold compared to the McCormick peppercorns I had been using. And from what I gather, this is a great price for Tellicherry peppercorns.<br /><br />My only concern is that it will take me and my wife a _long_ time to go through two pounds of this stuff. I actually purchased the two 1-Pound Bags instead of the one big glass jar. At the time I purchased, that was actually a little bit cheaper by ounce. Also, it comes in two packages, and the unopened one seems to be sealed well. Still, I plan on vacuum packing the packages between refills to help keep the flavor fresh.<br /><br />I can tell you this: I'll never again buy cheap pepper.",5,1
"""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" was director Tim Burton's first film but ""Beetlejuice"" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.",5,1
"My parents were visiting us in Las Vegas from the east coast. I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said ""you have to try these chips, (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy. I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them.

"I have tasted a lot of different types of bottled waters, and most are little more than once or twice purified city water, and the taste shows, they don't taste good at all, some even have a plastic-like taste...  Thankfully, that is not the case with this water, in regards to taste.<br /><br />  The bottle doesn't really say how many times it has been purified, and what process it uses to purify the water, but it does state it is Alkalized, which is supposed to be very good for your body.  I have a local Asian restaurant where all of their water (they do this themselves, they have a purifier and what-not) is purified through reverse osmosis and is then Alkalized, which they say, has been known to cure illnesses in countries like Japan for a very long time.  Water processed that way does have a pretty good taste.<br /><br />  I would have to say, although this water may seen expensive, it really isn't, the bottles are a little smaller then two liters, so they last a while, as well as the way it is processed as well.  Since the bottles are so large, this is more of a water you would drink around the house rather than take on the go with you, unless, say it was at work or in your car.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy",4,1

I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story.

We are recently embarking on a gluten free journey and were looking for a quick snack or breakfast food to have on hand for when we are to busy to cook a meal.

And it's not a miniscule amount for show, it's high up on the list (anything listed after the fat source in a bag of dry food is not a significant food source, though nutrients still of course need only be present in tiny amounts). Prairie is a really good all rounder food. I like the variety, the balance of the protein and fat for the average companion dog,  and the simple list of ingredients. I'd only love to see a probiotic source. They used to include inulin, curious why they dropped it. This was my base diet for my sedentary, retired dogs, for a few years.

I bought this stuff to take camping to use in recipes and in coffee/teas.  I spent two weeks in the woods and was really glad I bought this item.  It works great and as far as I know there's nothing weird in it unlike most powdered coffee creamers.  It does take a little longer to completely mix in but it's way better.  Note that this is not a milk substitute.  It is a superb cream replacement.,5,1

"We've been using this syrup for years, ever since we glimpsed it behind the counter at a Starbuck's in Cleveland. It's not too sweet and gives a good hint of vanilla with two shots into a twelve-ounce coffee, at least for me. I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, preferring black and unsweetened, but this passes muster with me and my (skim milk, light sweet coffee) wife. Also, it doesn't taste like it was made with a chemistry set. We always have a bottle next to our Keurig.<br />The price fluctuates, but typically three bottles on Amazon are the same price as one smaller bottle locally. The shelf life unopened is just fine.",5,1
Kids love to use this to make chocolate milk. It tends to be on the thick side if you are used to a Hershey's like consistency. Also wonderful on ice cream.,4,1
"Putting vital nutrients into your baby is obviously imperative, as you're starting them on the path to a life of (hopefully) good health. Baby Gourmet makes the task that much easier, by providing delicious, nutritious organic foods, in a convenient squeezable pouch. And the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens should be on the top of every parent's shopping list.<br /><br />Having sampled the product myself, I can say the texture is smooth and easy to digest -- perfect for getting your little one started on blended foods; and the taste is very flavorful, slightly sweet and fresh, as if I personally pureed the ingredients that morning. The pear really comes across, as do the earthy greens. Here is a quick breakdown of the nutrient data, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/2 Package (64g)<br />Calories: 40<br />Total Fat: 0<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carb: 9g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: less than 1g<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 25%, Vitamin C: 70%, Calcium: 100%, Iron: 2%<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate<br /><br />The relatively high price may prevent some from purchasing, but you'd be doing yourself -- and your infant -- a disservice by purchasing food that may not be made of such fine ingredients. As they say, you get what you pay for! Overall, Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens is an outstanding baby puree, made of quality, wholesome nutrients, that's fit for your infant and, really, family members of any age!",5,1
"Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems ""creamy"". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.",5,1
I had been getting these at the my grocery store and they stopped selling them.  I could not find them anywhere and came to Amazon for the purchase.  My cat loves them.,5,1
"Excellent pineapple.  Small pieces that are the right size.  The pieces are thin, soft and chewy. No added sugar.  Product of Costa Rica, hopefully they follow strick organic practices.  Very easy to eat the whole bag within a day or two.  Will be buying again.  I have found that Made in Nature brand to sell excellent tasty items.",5,1
"My wife is the coffee drinker in the family, a longtime fanatic of the bean.  These days she keeps a large can of Folger's French Roast Medium Dark in the fridge, and takes a foray into the more premium blends on a regular basis as a treat.  When I got the Melitta Classique Supreme for her as a trial, the yummy sounds could be heard throughout the house.  ""Even fuller, richer, and more robust,"" are her exact words.  Great stocking stuffer, at the least, and don't be surprised if it becomes your favorite.",5,1
"There is no remote, resemblance to anything chocolate OR donut in this flavor.  It has some, odd, objectionable chemical taste.  I could not think of any food item whatsoever even close to this disgusting ""flavor"".  What is in this?  I would like to know, but no way will you ever taste anything even close to how repulsive this is.",1,0
I purchased this as a surprise for my husband for it's his favorite flavor.  OH MY!  He said it was like his mother used to make.  I am so pleased with this purchase and with the shipping of this item.<br /><br />I purchased the Pear Preserves for it is my favorite preserve.. Good gracious is it good!<br /><br />I will definitely order again....,5,1
THIS DINNER WAS MUCH BETTER THAN MOST OF THE FROZEN ONES I HAVE TRIED.  WILL CONTINUE TO GET IT AS IT IS SO GOOD.,5,1
My scalp gets dry because I shampoo a lot and this product really helps to reverse the damage.  It feels like it goes deep and lasts a long time.  My hair feels all around healthier after only just a few uses.  It smells great too!,5,1
"I recently moved to Colorado, where it is always dry. Moisturizing body lotions alone just don't cut it for me. A friend introduced me to Nature's Way Coconut Oil and I fell in love. I mix it with my regular body lotion before applying it. My skin stays moisturized, feels baby soft, and does not feel oily. I have a problem with fragrances in general, and was at first worried about smelling like a coconut. However, that is not a problem at all; there is no scent. I've ordered this product twice so far and will continue to do so.",5,1
"These are the best tasting chips. They're are addicting; great taste, healthy ingredients, what else can one ask for?",5,1
"This is an excellent product! Just the right color, texture and taste. Tastes like those name brand more expensive small quantities sold. Five pounds is NOT too much for me - I love this stuff!",5,1
I ordered this tree for my Mom for Mothers day. It took about 6 days to receive it which I expected. My Mom called and said she loves it! The tree is perfect with no dead leaves and is in a pretty blue water bowl as shown. Also has another little plant with it as shown in picture. She was delighted and so am I!,5,1
"Now that I have found nirvana in the form of red licorice, there is no reason to keep trying other brands.  The texture is completely satisfying, the way the log gives way to soft chewy goodness, the way the hint of slightly sour essence of pure raspberry rises to the top.  Unlike other high end licorice I've tried, there are no artificial colors like Kookaburra, and the texture is so much more RIGHT than Panda (which has more of a sticky wheat-type texture and less berry flavor).  I'm sold on this form of life pleasure.",5,1
"First, I wish they'd change the picture--it's an old one and the boxes look much different now.  I requested that they do months ago but they (Amazon) haven't. OK, to the review.  Kashi cereals are great but most of them have too much sugar for me. This one doesn't and has so many benefits. It's whole grain and delicious. It's similar to Grape Nuts but without all the junk that Grape Nuts has and it takes so much better.  You can eat it plain with milk or I love it in place of a granola topping.  In the mornings I eat fruit and yogurt with flax and chia seeds and top with these Kashi Whole Grain Nuggets and viola Healthy Yumminess.  It fills one up and lasts for hours.",5,1
"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why.",2,0
"I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />""Feullitees Doree,"" which can be bought on in France.",5,1
What can i say? I'm addicted to it and I've gotten everyone I know addicted to it too. Soooo good.,5,1
"I have a 6 year-old black lab mix and a 2 year-old lhasa-poo that were both having major allergy issues...they would puke every day on Iams, Eukanuba and even the low-res stuff the vet gave me.  I tried a pre-packaged raw diet, but it was a bit pricey for 3 dogs.  I found this one and I'll never go back to another.  I haven't had any issues with this one in the year they've been on it...my dogs love it and my third black lab has the most BEAUTIFUL coat!  I'm extremely happy with the results of this food!",5,1
My dogs love this product and this was the cheapest I could find it any where. Shipped and received as notified when purchased.,5,1
"I have been ordering this through Amazon and direct from Muir Glen for almost a year and every shipment has at least 1 broken jar.  Besides paying for 6 and getting 5, it's a mess to cleanup since all the jars end up covered in sauce and i have to carefully remove the broken glass.  But i prefer to order it since it's hard to get the exact sauces I want in the supermarket and I order several 6 packs at a time so I don't have to constantly buy it. If you don't mind paying for 6 and getting 5, it's an excellent product and it arrives quickly.",4,1
"These are the best chips ever!  They are unsalted and being on a low sodium diet critical in allowing my husband and I to eat chips.  They are all natural and low fat which is a great extra bonus.  Additionally they have the BEST flavor...you really taste the potato flavor and not the salt!  I would choose these chips over ANY chip on the market today, salted or not!! These chips as well as ANY unsalted chips are very hard to find in the stores so THANK YOU Amazon for selling them.",5,1
"I recently bought a 50 pack of the Tully's Italian Roast K-cups and could not be more pleased w/ my purchased...all of the cups were intact, none were damaged and I have yet to experience any of them exploding in the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Shipping was rather quick and yes, they did come in a box, they were not in any type of holder inside the box but that was not an issue.<br /><br />For the $$$ I paid I found this purchase to be a very good value.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy this and enjoy great tasting coffee from your Keurig.",4,1
"My dogs love these and they smell so good I have been tempted to try them!!!  I bought the chicken variety.  They are way small so great for training purposes so that you don't overfeed your dog in the process of teaching him good behaviors.  Plus, they are natural so must be good for the doggies.  I will definitely order them again when we run out.  Shipping wasn't the speediest on this item which I found strange because I have the Amazon prime 2 day shipping.  Not super slow, but it was longer than a week before I got them so I had to buy some others to use in the meantime.  Maybe it got lost in the mail, not sure.  One of my dogs will not stop begging for these when he sees I have the treat pouch!",5,1
"Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as ""dishwater."" In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend.",1,0
"I was hesistant about such a mixture but I want what's best for my baby so I bought it.  It doesn't look the most appetizing but my baby LOVED it!  This will be a constant food for him until he moves on to the next stage - love, love, love this brand!",5,1
"This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning.",4,1
"This tea with its very cool pyramid-shaped bags is intensely fruity and very tasty. Because it's caffeine-free, it makes a great dessert or bedtime treat.",5,1
"I became a vegetarian about three years ago, and before that, Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this, I immediately bought it. However, this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy, and tasted like bread, and the supposed ""Teriyaki"" flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it, so I'm returning it. If you buy, I guarantee you'll be sorry.",1,0
"Great product, tastes great. I mixed this with some banana cream pudding and it was heavenly. The coconut flavor and smell it gives is incredible. I also add 2 tblsp to my green tea with honey and it gives my tea that extra yum factor. Will be reordering this product and i am currently actively trying out new recipes for this. I bought 2-16 oz jars, but i can quickly see that will not be enough as i will be using it on skin and hair. This is the real deal, it is not the refined oil you find in grocery stores. Refined vs Unrefined, i'll go with unrefined.",5,1
"My wife likes all things crunchy.  Chips are her favorite food and she loves these chips.  Me, on the other hand, never met a chip I liked -- until now.  These are, without a doubt, the best-tasting, most addictive snack food ever.  We stumbled on them while vacationing in Montana. When we got home, I bought a box of 12 bags from Amazon and devoured them in two weeks.  Remember that chip ad from many years ago:  ""I bet you can't eat just one?""  Well, I bet you can't!!",5,1

"There isn't much to say about this variety of Knorr's pasta line besides stay away.  It's not very cheesy and there's no real bacon flavor.  I can only be grateful that I bought two packs of this at the grocery store to try first before ordering a case from Amazon, because it was so bad I couldn't even finish the first packet.  If you've got to buy a cheesy Knorr side, go for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00099XOVO"">Knorr/Lipton Rice & Sauce, Cheddar Broccoli, 5.7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.  It's average, but unlike this pasta, edible.",1,0
"My family and I have enjoyed Nutella the past few years. Amazon has a good price, about $2.81 a jar. It ranges here in Kansas around $3-4 a jar. It's basically ground up hazelnuts (also known as filberts), mixed with a chocolate frosting type deal... spreads on toast, very sweet. We also like natural peanut butter (meaning without hydrogenated oils etc. just peanut, salt) and we typically swirl on two thin layers. My son LOVES this in his school lunches or for breakfast (""brekky"") on toast.<br /><br />Some lady asked about this at the grocery store, wondering what it tasted like, as she'd heard it was an alternative to peanut butter for those who were allergic to peanut butter. The jar I currently have does not give any of the warning disclaimers about ""...produced in factory that has exposure to peanuts or whatever other allergic product... "" thing (sorry I don't remember how they usually read but I am not seeing it here on this one, so presumably it's okay. For questions go to www.NutellaUSA.com or 1-800-NUTELLA ).<br /><br />Tt is sometimes hard to find at our various grocery stores - usually clear up at the top shelf almost out of my reach - especially at places like Wal-mart supercenters or the Target Superstores (I forget what they call them), and it tends to be more expensive at places like World Market.<br /><br />This one also says it was made in USA by Ferrero USA, Inc.<br /><br />Seems like 8 or 9 years ago when we first started seeing it on the shelves and buying it, it was actually imported from Italy. But apparently not now. But would be interesting to see the nutritional breakdown for the product still made in Italy. Typically I've noticed other products (like Malted Milk products etc.) produced for the Asian or European markets use less sugars than the one produced for us (unfortunately mostly overweight) Americans. So would be interesting to see what has happnened to Nutella.<br /><br />Otherwise... hey... it's pretty good!!",5,1
"I started buying these as a more nutritious snack option for the kids than regular chips. They thought they were pretty tasty, and a decent substitute for regular chips. I myself got hooked on them! Our local store stopped carrying the exclusively sweet potato chips, and only has the mix, which I don't like as much. I highly recommend them if you enjoy the taste of sweet potatoes and can live without a salty snack. These don't need extra salt--they are delicious on their own.",5,1
"I love these!  They have the same flavor as Oreos, with a very similar texture.  As with most gluten-free things, they are a tad grainy, but this is easily overlooked!!!  Definitely something to keep on hand (and in hand).",5,1
I haven't been able to get these since i moved out to the east coast and i was really surprised and happy that i was able to find them on amazon.  A great spicy snack from the great minds of Lakeside foods.,5,1
"I did not read the reviews before ordering these K-Cups.  This was my first time ordering K-cups through Amazon (I normally do it from BBB).  I did not even think to read the reviews because how could they screw it up.  Boy was I wrong.  The packaging was my first clue that something was off.  It was in a brown paper bag, not a manufactures box.  Then when I opened it it was all of these strange flavors and very little straight up coffee.  I am so confused, I would think that the FDA would regulate coffee (I might be wrong here) and that this would not meet their standards.  I agree with someone else who said that it appears to be all the coffee and flavors that someone else did not want.  I may try to return but again not sure if that is possible because it is edible.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!",1,0
Items arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Will do business again with this vendor.,5,1
I'm not a fruit fan but I love this stuff. Will order again. The flavor is so good. And to top it off it's sugar free.,5,1
"I started taking Fenugreek when I went back to work.  Despite exclusively pumping since my baby was 6 weeks old, Fenugreek helped keep my milk production up.  I was able to exclusively breastfeed my baby until she turned 13 months... all with the help of my trusty pump and Fenugreek.",5,1
"This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.",2,0

"I just bought these at my local supermarket for $5. They are also available at Costco for the same price. World Gourmet makes great products but they charge a fortune to ship. I wish I could order their Apple Straws (yum!) directly from them because they're hard to find in the stores but the shipping charges are crazy. While these are listed with ""Free Shipping"", the price for the shipping has already been built into the product price. Great product though!",5,1
Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also,5,1
That should tell you something about the quality of this product. I switched her to California Naturals immediately after seeing her literally turn her nose up at this brand. She took to CA Naturals and loves the food.,1,0
"I am very pleased with the taste but disappointed in the text of the written advertisement.<br /><br />The fiber content is about one half of 1 g per cookies. A serving, of two cookies, contains 1 g of fiber but 3 g of fat. I don't think this ratio indicates healthy!<br /><br />I will not reorder.",4,1
They are a little smaller and slightly less fluffy than traditional marshmallows but sooooo good!<br /><br />I actually like them better than regular ones.  They're a little bit sweeter with a slight vanilla flavor.  Yummy!,5,1
I love this green tea. It has a wonderful brown rice flavor that makes it very tasty. I highly recommend it.,5,1
"I am a health-conscious freshman college student and I absolutely hate my meal plan! I was frustrated with the lack of healthy food the cafeteria was serving so I decided to order Dr. Mcdougall's split pea soup along with the lentil cous cous soup. One word describes both of these products: AMAZING! I only have a water heater in my tiny little two person dorm room and that is all I need to make a meal! Not only is this product low cal but also low sodium and it doesn't even taste bland! It is super filling and I always look forward to eating this soup, especially on a cold winter day!",5,1

"My westie has food allergies and has had tummy problems since a puppy. He had soft stools and was gassy. I fed him really good food. He started scratching, licking paws, and getting waxy yeasty ears. He would vomit first thing in the morning. These are all signs of food allergies. I tried the grain free foods. They seemed to help but he still had problems. I changed his food to one brand and he got very sick to the point he had to spend a couple days at the vets. My vet recomended the California Natural no Grain. My dog is doing so much better. His stools are normal, almost no gas, and his itching is almost gone. If he does get grain like a stray cracker or cheerio he is a sorry puppy (he just turned one) for a couple of days. I'm so happy my vet recommended it and it is available at other places too.",5,1

"PROS: This 5-pounder packs up heavily for the entire family (or even the office) to enjoy. Yummy flavors, that's surprisingly all natural & organic (how can anything so delicious be so organic?).<br /><br />Not too sweet, and really intense flavors, as well.<br /><br />CONS: Packaging needs heavy improvement, as some of the sticks protrudes on the thin plastic packaging. Also had 2 opened pops, and 2 sticks (without the lollies) inside.<br /><br />Varieties were inconsistent, had way too many watermelons, and too few blueberries.<br /><br />...but who's complaining anyways??? :)",4,1
"My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!",5,1

"I'll be short and to the point.  This is a very good product.<br /><br />Each Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruit serving has only 70 calories, but is all organic with no added sugar.  I think it's a great snack for adults as well as kids.  I'm one of those people with a sweet tooth and I've got to have some form of sweets around at all times.  One thing is for sure, munching on one of these is a lot better for you than reaching for that candy bar.<br /><br />The only slight criticisms I have is that it's a touch more tart than expected and the primary ingredients are ""apple puree"" and ""apple juice concentrate"" with no specific mention of strawberries.  Also, while the price is a reasonable value, it's not a terrific one.  I'd strongly recommend that you consider the ""Subscribe and Save"" option, which knocks an extra 15% off of the price.  You can always cancel S&S later if you change your mind, so there's no downside to signing up and it will save you money.",5,1

"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.",2,0

"I brew this Bigelow Earl Grey tea using the 6oz setting on my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KJXSHO"">Keurig® Platinum B70</a>. It is by far the best Earl Grey for the Keurig systems and I have tried them all. I went through several of the ""Tea<br />Packages""; random assortments of various teas packaged together available here on Amazon. Most seemed artificial, bland, or simply didn't compare to their bagged counterparts. This was not only my favorite Earl Grey but also one of my favorite teas in general available in K-cups.<br /><br />For a little more perspective, I am an avid tea drinker. I consume 10-15 cups of tea a day. A majority of the tea I consume is Matcha or Hunmatsu-RyokuCha. I never mix sugar or milk into my tea. As such, I am particularly interested in teas that are robust and flavorful and not bitter. The bagged Bigelow is very good, not my favorite bagged Earl Grey but very good none the less. The K-cup variety is very close to the bagged version. For this I applaud them as few others can say this.<br /><br />That being said, our machines are perfectly capable of providing hot water for bagged teas. So why the K-cups? Convenience. Regardless of how good this and other K-cup varieties may be, nothing compares to a slow steep. Be it a bag, steeper or infuser they will always win over the instant cup varieties. However, nothing I have found beats the convenience of the Keurig system when it comes to guests and a good cup of coffee/tea. The Keurig system is so easy to use it takes little to no effort on the hosts part to provide a guests favorite beverage as our guests can brew a cup themselves! It's for this reason alone that I have gone through so many varieties of both to ensure an adequate selection of what I consider a good cup of joe and a great cup of tea.",5,1

Don't look at the time I finished mine and think negatively on the candy; I have the sweet-tooth of a child, xD! (For the record, my tongue is sore from the record time I took to finish it. I think I'll give one to a buddy of mine since they want one). They arrived in great condition, nothing chipped and packaged in a way that they wouldn't break either.

Absolutely delicious.  Very crispy and fresh.  And you can't beat this price.  They come in a poly bag and you can fill them in some smaller containers and use as you need. They stay fresh for a long time.  Indeed a very healthy snack alternative.,5,1

"I found these bars to be way too sticky and sweet.  This seems to be yet another one of these products that is trying to make you think it is healthy by plugging into the granola bar genre, but they blow it by making it as sweet as a candy bar.  Texture-wise it is like chewing sticky caramel with stuff embedded in it.<br /><br />Additionally, the peanuts tasted a slight bit stale to me (even though the date stamp on the bar wrapper was 4 months away).  To be sure, I compared this product with a freshly opened jar of Planters Dry Roasted Lite Salt Peanuts, and those tasted nice and fresh compared to the stale peanuts in these bars.  Too bad the manufacturer couldn't do a better job with peanut delivery, I wanted to like this product.",1,0
"This year I took a chance on this chocolate. I normally use a block<br />of chocolate but the callets are so much easier to work with and<br />melt even more easily.

May contain traces of milk protein.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I made up for chocolates during<br />the holiday season. The addition of cinnamon is really delicious.<br /><br />Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon<br /><br />A double boiler is not recommended for melting the chocolate.

Creme de la creme of sea salt. Great taste and I love the color!<br />Perfect size granules to use for a table or cooking salt.,5,1
Received this fast and packaged well to protect my product .. Thanks for the great service .. I will definitley use you again ..,5,1
"We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.",4,1
"This stuff is just the greatest.  My rescue dog just absolutely loves this frozen beef.  I mix it with her kibble and she eats the entire dish.  This little girl is very, very fussy about her dog food.  Also, when we go out for walks, I cut a disc up into small pieces to use for treats.  If your dog is a fusy eater, try this product.",5,1
"This stuff tastes better than any other dressing I've tried.  Other Italian dressings -- both light and regular -- taste comparatively bitter and low-quality, but this is sharp, salty and savoury.  A sprinkling of bacon bits and shredded cheddar on romaine enhances the flavour even more.<br /><br />The spray bottle concept may seem a little strange, but it creates a perfectly light and evenly-distributed flavour for your salad.  15-20 sprays on a small salad will create plenty of flavour and still be extremely low calorie.<br /><br />It's fantastic and the only dressing I care to use.  If it ever goes out of production, I'll be stock-piling :)",5,1

I did not expect these to taste just as good as regular pretzels but they do. Even my husband likes them and he usually turns his nose up at my wheat free foods.  For the first time I can fix Chex Mix with these and Rice Chex and enjoy it along with every one else.  Hurray for Gluten Free Pretzel Twists!,5,1

"Yum! This tastes just like the masaman curry I always order at our favorite fancy Thai restaurant. It only costs a fraction of the price to make it at home, and it's so easy!

"I am a person that if my food smells off, I probably won't eat it. When I opened the wrapper, I got this funny whiff of odd sugary something... I know that is not the best explanation, but it was hard to pin down. Everything was stuck to the wrapper so maybe it gives off an odor when heated. Just a guess. In regards to the natural ingredients, I appreciated that they made sure to use as few fillers as possible. I would try another flavor anytime.",4,1
"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.",1,0

"I was a little wary about ordering jerky off the internet since I have never tried this brand before.  Not to worry, this buffalo jerky is good quality and tastes great.  I will be ordering this again.",5,1
"I used to feed my then two month old puppy chicken jerky treats from Sams. It was cheap and he LOVED it. However, he started getting bloody diarrhea. This happened twice before I finally realized it was the jerky by researching this online. Since my puppy was also eating Greenies, Zuke's chicken treats, Milk Bones, Milk Bones Trail Mix, Iams Puppy dog food, Royal Canin food (digestion formula), puppy vitamins, Platos chicken treats, Natures Recipe food and treats, his puppy trainer's treats, and Benadryl (he has dermatitis), it was hard to pinpoint what the cause was. But once I figured it out, I stopped the Waggin Train and switched to Platos. Although these treats are more expensive and contain preservatives, it does seem a better alternative to liver failure or sudden death some pet owners were experiencing with chicken jerky treats.<br /><br />As for the seemingly biased reviews against jerky treats coming from China, I am a first generation Chinese immigrant with family back East, and I love them and where I am from, but shady practices are abound in China. So no xenophobia driven bias here, I have seen the damage done to my pup by Chinese treats, and these Platos treats are definitely a safer bet.<br /><br />The FDA statement regarding Chinese chicken treats can be found here:<br />[...]",5,1
"This is a great product.  I'll be ordering more of it.  I have used it in place of Gatorade and Propel and other similar sports drinks that were just way too sweet for me.  This provides the right amount of refreshment for me after hours on the court and has higher levels of potassium than the other drinks (which is important for me because while a lot of people just consume bananas courtside, I can't do that due to allergic reactions to them).  Flavor is mild, but you definitely taste the coconut.",5,1
"I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from ""itchy butt"" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.",5,1
I love this tea from Arizona.  In the stores it's about $3.79 a box!  I buy my Arizona tea online and save a bundle as I drink this tea all the time and never tire of it as I love the Mandarin Orange taste and aroma.  Well worth trying.  Great product.,5,1

Stash's Organic Ceylon is no exception - it has a good, but subtle flavor.<br /><br />The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Assam for an easy drinking English-style tea.",4,1

"Truth is, the LoL Mini-Moo's are everything they are promised.  I can't take my coffee w/o cream, that being real cream half-and-half.  That flavored liquid stuff and powered stuf just doesn't cut it... so these are the PERFECT ticket when you don't hav a place to refrigerate the store-bought stuff.  The only reason it didn't get more stars is the indicated ""Shelf-life"" date.  It's like 2 months after purchase.  With the UHT method and no refrige-needed, I cannot understand why this isn't more shelf-stable longer??  I plan on keeping it in a sporadically used kitchenette, an ofice setting is perfect, so I hope it lasts longer than the 2 months.  I wish Lo'L would include some printed information regarding why the short life in the package, but alas, nothing.<br />Otherwise, good stuff!",4,1
I couldn't find the Nursing Tea at any of my local supermarkets or health food stores. I found this brand here on Amazon. I was able to get six boxes on sale. It was a great price.

"This tea is just so so so so so so so goooddddd!!! Can't have enough of it. Bought it last evening and had a cup of it and was raving all through the entire cup. Today, I had two cups and I felt like I wanted to have more. This tea has no sugar (read up its nutritional info on net). I am a mint lover and I love mint in everything. But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.",5,1

"If you like strong, dark coffee, the Barista Italian roast for the Vue cup is excellent. I make it on the STRONG setting for 8oz and it's perfect. In fact, it's better than what I make in my regular pot unless I have very fresh coffee just ground from beans. The color is a rich, blackish brown, the roast is dark but not burnt-tasting and of all the coffees for the Vue I've tried, this one wins hands-down. I have the same blend in K-cups (for the office, where the K version sits) and they are not as good, for some reason. The Vue is not the most economical way to make coffee (that would probably be a plastic Melitta filter with a paper cone and a mug or a French Press) but the Keurig is fast and convenient. And I get the coffee the strength and temperature just the way I like it.",5,1

They were awful, and we ended up throwing them away. A real bummer....a great cheeseburger on a bun is the thing I miss most being a celiac! Do try their Coffee Cake, though.

"This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of.",5,1

When I contacted Candy Crate, they wanted the candy sent back.  I have never been asked to send food back before. How do you send back opened food???  and what do they do with the returned candy?  Maybe this is why my candy was so bad!!!!  They refused any type of satisfaction to me.  Also Amazon did NOT back me with their A to Z Guarantee.  First time Amazon has not come through for me.  I am a long time customer that will have to consider this before I use Amazon again.  Dissapointed in both Candy Crate and Amazon!!!!!",1,0
"I had purchased these hummus chips, sesame garlic, at a health food store and loved the true flavor of garlic and sesame.  I purchased a whole case from amazon the next week.  They are not like the typical snack chip you find in the grocery store, the humbles brand is healthy yet has intense flavor, you can tell right away with the first taste that they don't have that heavy salty oily taste like some chips have. I will purchase these chips again.",5,1
"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",5,1
"I was so hoping to like this product!  I need to eat lower carb foods, and hoped that this product would deliver.  The package came in & the smell was bad, but not as horid as suggested.  After par boiling it was much better.  I cooked the noodles & put on sauce $ cheese.  The texture was not good.  It was like chewing pieces of rubber.  The noodles even squeaked on my teeth sort of like a balloon would sound...wierd.  Suffice it to say that I could not choke down more than a couple of bites.  The worst (and funniest) part was letting my dogs have the plate & watching them first try to chew the noodles, and finally lap only the sauce & cheese up. Save your money.  The shipping was killer on this.",1,0
I love it so much and i get it very fast. I will order it again ...thanks very much .,5,1
I've only had my Keurig since March and have been ordering and consuming coffees which are labeled 'extra bold'. I first ordered Green Mountain Double Diamond which I thought was great. I then ordered Starbucks Sumatra which was also good but seemingly inconsistent with regard to taste (strange). I received Jet Fuel today. I thought it was going to be hard to top the Double Diamond but Coffee People have done did it! This stuff is FANTASTIC!! I will definitely be ordering this again and again.,5,1
"I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce.",1,0
"Great Coffee taste with all the flavors of fresh ground coffee and a French Press with out the mess.  Solofill Cup is almost idiot proof.  If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.",5,1
"I love On The Border. I mean LOVE. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long. I saw this salsa in the store and thought I'd give it a shot. I had little hope it'd be anything like their salsa. It is very close, if not exactly like the salsa served at On The Border. It's delish!",5,1
"For some weird reason, the ""powers that be"" have decided that we poor folk here in Ohio are not allowed to have this available for purchase anymore.  Just as it became my absolute favorite, now it's gone!  We ARE allowed, however, to buy the raspberry so that's a great substitute!  Anyway, be SURE to try this if you can get it.  It's absolutely outstanding sweetened with honey!  Highly recommend!",5,1
I have been hosting backyard movies every summer for the past 5 years and I love using this popcorn at the concession stand. It has the real movie theater taste and it makes plenty for our guests. great product and company!,5,1
"I'm an avid tea drinker and seldom use tea bags but I'll have a few bags handy for convenience and because they have long shelf lives so I don't have to worry about using them up soon.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French brand but it's a pretty common one that you can find in many stores. The brand has been around for a long time. I like the fact that this tea is organic.<br /><br />I agree with the above poster that the bergamot taste in this one is pretty subtle. The tea itself has a somewhat dusky taste which is not bad and which sets itself apart from other Earl Grey's. Overall, it's not a bad tea and I recommend it.",5,1
"Our little chihuahuas are picky eaters. I really don't find canned foods helpful, since they won't eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight. These are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble. Even better, when we travel, these are easy to open and carry.<br /><br />Of all of the selections, the beef chicken combo is their favorite! They always gobble this one up right away.",5,1
The Murray's pecan shortbread sugar-free cookies are my favorite of sugar-free cookies.  The grocery stores that I frequent didn<br />t seem  to stock these cookies.  The product is excellent.,5,1
"Great price and great mellow flavor.  Depending on my mood, I drink this and Tully's Italian Roast...sometimes Dark Magic by Green Mountain.  Three great k-cups!",5,1
"Pure Habanero added amazing flavor and great heat to a recent batch of chili I made. It seemed to add a depth to the flavors that were already present as well as its own amazing flavor. A few drops to several cups at a time really kicked up the heat which is exactly what I was looking for though I certainly would sample straight from the bottle. Speaking of the bottle though, the extract is very thick and the bottle is glass with a narrow neck. It's just about impossible to get anything out. I used a straw but a better bottle design would be nice or include a suction dropper like children's medicines come with.",5,1
"It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!",5,1
"We had been feeding our large breed puppy another brand of premium dog food but for some reason, his stools were always loose.  Since switching to Fromm's he's been great.  No more loose stools and he's gaining weight at a nice, steady pace.  Love this food.",5,1
"This is a great cereal.  My kids, grandkids, and I have been hooked on this since it came out.  We really like it in a big bowl with white...OR chocolate milk.  Kids don't usually like to drink the milk left after the cereal is gone?  No problem. The milk is delicious, also.  There are more marshmallow pieces than Lucky Charms and they are larger in size.  We usually get the big bag and it lasts...oh, maybe a week.  Try 'em.",5,1
These brownies are absolutely wonderful. My family likes them better than the original Betty Crocker brownies. They are moist and really satisfying to that chocolate craving.,5,1
"This ready-made pie crust is the best!  Low in fat, no trans fat, and great taste. Can use as is or bake for a few minutes to bring out the flavor. Wish it were more readily available!",5,1
"I use this product almost everyday for cooking.  In the store, four little bottles cost as much as a gallon!  Kitchen Bouquet has been used by my whole family even as a kid, and if you want higher quality than this, you will not find it!  Spectacular!",5,1
We love the Hazelnut coffee in our house! Great flavor and the coffee isn't bitter or too strong. I also love the price! Buying it here in a pack of 50 makes it cheaper than any of the stores in our city.,5,1
"I like how mild this is.  It works and is much less expensive than most products that work.  I wash my face, apply this for five minutes and it leaves my face so soft and clean.  After removing, I then put <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V0YL4U"">Swisa Beauty Anti-Aging Cream, 1.01 -Ounce</a> on my face.  My face is soft and smooth and my skin looks younger.",5,1
"I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts...the flavored Blue Diamond Almonds are hard to find, so I am happy to find them on Amazon.  Even better to have them delivered to my door FAST & FREE!  Thanks Amazon and Blue Diamond!",5,1
"In the UK many, if not most, people use digestive biscuits as a base for cheesecakes etc. Crush them in a plastic bag and use like Graham crackers. I've found people seem to prefer the base produced with the digestive biscuits",5,1
"...even the one who is not fussy and will eat damn near anything.  They would even rather have dry food than this.  Not sure why they are so put off by it, but I won't be buying it again.",1,0
"This is always a favorite in our house! You can never go wrong with this,even if you drink it black, like I do ,or add flavored creamer, like my daughter and her boyfriend does. Either way it is GOOD !",5,1
"I had high hopes for this product, but I was seriously disappointed. I was expecting good quality beef jerky, but it is definitely not.<br /><br />The good: it's not tough like leather - it's actually pretty moist and unlikely to go stale once you open it because of the individually wrapped packages. It's also sold at a good price.<br /><br />The bad: I could detect basically no taste of black pepper at all, which was supposed to be the main flavor. Instead, it has a strange taste I can't put my finger on -- more chemical than natural. I've had plenty of black pepper-flavored jerky, and none of them tasted like this.<br /><br />Unless you're on a serious budget, I would avoid this product. Perhaps the other varieties taste better, but I'm not willing to risk it.",2,0
"This is incredible smelling and tasting coffee. I'm fortunate to live in a city that's known for it's coffee, so I'm spoiled when it comes to being able to get a good cup of joe. This Melitta Cafe coffee is the best, pre-ground, home brewed coffee I've ever had, hands down. As cheesy as it sounds, I even had one of those television commercial moments when I first opened the bag: I said ""Ah!"" and inhaled the woody and nutty aroma deeply. I was instantly sold. The coffee is ground very fine, allowing all the flavor to end up in your cup and not in the trash, garden, or food bin. Even when watered down to make an iced drink the flavor stays prominent. This would be a great blend for homemade coffee ice cream or desserts that use non-instant coffee as an ingredient. I would and have recommended this brand to family and friends.",5,1
"We have gotten into reviving old cocktail recipes, ie Manhattan, Old Fashioned, etc.  Many of these call for maraschino cherries, which usually means the neon red plastic super sweet tasteless things in the jar at the supermarket. We ordered Luxardo cherries from Italy and WOW!  These are the real thing. The cocktails are so much better.  As usual, when you decide to make something yourself, always use the best ingredients. You will be rewarded when you taste the results. These cherries are great!",5,1
"This is the best chai tea I have tasted, and since it has 100% of the caffeine of coffee, I usually have 1-2 cups in the morning. Highly recommended",5,1
"Good nuts, very few ""duds"". The price has recently gone up, probably due to the recently imposed embargo on Iranian pistachios. Also the last time I checked to re-order, Amazon was available only through a ""seller"", that did not offer ""free shipping""...So I am back to buying at Walmart or Sams Club for now.",5,1
"This coconut oil is fantastic - high quality, and it smells really great.  Amazon had the best prices for anything similar, and we will definitely get this again.",5,1
"I love this product.  I have so many uses for it, I'm afraid I will have to order more often than I had originally planned.  Only thing, as Medusa (above) said, I also wish it came in a glass jar.",5,1
This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISN'T! It's weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers.,1,0
"This is the best olive oil and well worth the price, but very hard to find.  So I was very happy to find it on Amazon and will be a regular customer now.  Great value, too, for such an outstanding product.",5,1
"I first found out about this tea when my husband and I went to England & France. When we got back in the USA, we found it in an international grocery store. I was so excited!",4,1
These were purchased for a candy bar at a wedding.  They stayed fresh and were delicious!  Thank you for supplying a great product.,5,1
"I'm a fan of regular Appletinis so tried this mocktail mixture with a little Vodka at a game party last weekend. Passing the mixed drink around, everyone commented on how delicious it was and actually masked the taste of the Vodka.<br /><br />All in all, Crystal Light has taken away a great deal of my guilt for enjoying a tasty cocktail :)",5,1
My first experience with 3in1 San Mig Coffee was in Davao City Philippines. I dont drink much coffee but tried this at the hotel I was staying and found the taste to be a great satisfying morning drink. I brought some home and plan to introduce my employees to this quick and easy idea for those who have to have coffee in the mornings or throughout the day. Quick and easy and satisfying.,4,1
Received fresh and soft and on time. Licorice lovers will love this product! The price was a good one too after comparing other sites prices.,5,1
"Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.",4,1
"My dogs look forward to their daily treat of Greenies.  Daily reward plus breath freshener for dogs.  Great price for the value size container, fast shipping.",5,1
"Snackwell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is a sweet and salty snack, prepackaged in 130 calories pouches. The portion sizes are very small to account for such a decadent snack at a decent calorie amount. The caramel popcorn is simply delicious, drizzled lightly with fudge. The flavor is incredible, and would be easy to over-indulge if it weren't for the perfectly portioned (calorie-wise) pouches. As a popcorn-lover, I highly recommend this sweet treat. It's almost as good has mom's homemade caramel corn.",4,1
Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.  I have been enjoying the tea going on one week.,5,1
"I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more. If you come accross Turkish from brands other than Caykur, try to choose Caykur brand.",5,1
I have bought several different varieties of the KIND bars.  They have all been good.  My favorite so far has been the Almond & coconut.  They are a great snack- they are very chewy & nutty.  I like them because I can't eat them quickly (which I often do with other bars) so I end up feeling more satisfied.  They have a great mix of almond & coconut flavor along with a very light honey tast.  Buy them- you won't be disappointed!,5,1
"I'm not a coffee snob, so move on to another review if you want a critique of the flavor of the coffee.  This coffee tastes just fine to me.  The price per cup is about the cheapest that I can find.  I've gone through about 40 cups and every one of them has worked as designed -- no leaks or other problems.  I was satisfied with my purchase and bought a second time after I used up the first quantity.",5,1
All my dogs enjoy this product.  They can't get enough.  It is packed with healthy ingredients so I don't mind giving them this treat often.  I can't keep up on the orders as they go through them so quickly.  They are offered through subscription order on Amazon and you save a good amount. I compared the prices with the local pet supply store and these treats go $5.99+ a bag whereas I am paying $21.34 for six bags and free shipping.  I am very satisfied.,5,1
"I was unable to make my sister's birthday because there are several states between us. I looked everywhere for an affordable cake. I was leery of sending one through the mail, one I made myself or otherwise. I contacted Scott and told him I was putting my order in early and please try to get it to her closer to her birthday. It arrived ON HER BIRTHDAY and she said it looked delicious. Never heard how it tasted, but I am sure I would have heard if it wasn't excellent! Definitely going on the list to use in the future! Thank you Scott!",5,1
"This order of crackers was burned, the entire case! The tops of the crackers were falling off because of it.<br /><br />If you like burned crackers, then these are for you.<br /><br />The price has also increased. Let's see now, burned crackers, super high price. Do you really want to purchase this item?<br /><br />Where oh where is Susie and quality control?",2,0
"My husband is the ultimate food snob and I would find him crunching on these biscotti all the time.  Also my daughter would pack these in her lunch, they are not too hard, so you don't have to dip them into coffee, they are perfect.",5,1
"My dogs are occasionally picky about their treats, but whenever I pull out the Smokehouse Chicken Poppers their eyes light up and they will do anything to get them.  They will turn their noses up at soft treats and go for the Chicken Poppers instead.  An excellent training treat too.  They are wonderful.",5,1
This is an awesome and distinctive product. It provides a very different and delicate flavor to you saute'd vegetables. My family absolutely loves it. You don't need very much and it doesn't burn like butter. Try it! Go half and half or go all the way. It is very versaltile.,5,1
"My older cat, male, has had issues with dehydration, constipation (I know, too much information), so I tried one of these and he drinks quite a bit, and so I've started to mix a little water in it. He's 14, was getting very thin, and it seems that this has helped him put on a little weight.",5,1
"Despite the negative reviews, I tried the syrup anyway.  I was quite pleased with it.  I guess when you are expecting a burnt tootsie roll/listerine flavor, you get a pleasant surprise when it's pallatable.  I really think the negative remarks were way off base.  If you buy any sugar free syrup and expect it to taste like the original, your expectations are too high.  All the Davinici sugar free syrups are good.  Some taste a little too similar to the others to bother with.  I have narrowed down my favorites as:<br /><br />1. White Chocolate<br />2. Almond<br />3. Carmel<br />4. French Vanilla<br /><br />If you are looking to make a mocha, my suggestions is to do half Davinci Sugar Free Sauce and half Davinci Sugar Free Syrup.  It makes a great sweet chocolatey mocha.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that Davinci Sugar Free syrups are superior to Torani Sugar Free.  They are much more flavorful and require less syrup to achieve the desired taste.<br /><br />Good luck, and don't give up on this chocolate syrup.",4,1
"a bit runny but baby loves it! I can add a little oatmeal to thicken it. It is very sweet. I thought it would be more like a veggie, but no it's a fruit taste.",5,1
"I believe that this is one of the best dry foods on the market.<br /><br />If you check the review of this food on Dog Food Analysis, it gets their highest start rating.<br /><br />Just the look of the food looks like a real good quality too and my dogs love it.<br /><br />It seems denser than a lot of the other dry foods I have tried. I also read somewhere that because it is a better quality food, you do not need to feed as much as you would with an average food, so although it is a more expensive cost, you do feed less, so better in the long run.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",5,1
"If you like to eat bananas and food bars, this is the best combination of both that I have ever had!<br />And here at Amazon I think that you will find them at the best price.<br />You won't regret!",5,1
"Namaste mixes really are quite tasty.  The texture is smooth and in general they are as good to me as a gluten eater as those made with wheat.  Having such good quality mixes would help the transition to a G/F diet for those who suffer mildly from gluten sensitivity and also for their families.<br /><br />One thing that is inaccurate in their packaging is the meaning of the word namaste.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision June 2003, taken literally, it means ""I bow to you"". The word is derived from Sanskrit (namas): to bow, obeisance, reverential salutation, and (te): ""to you"".<br /><br />Some Hindus believe that this greeting recognizes the divinity in eachother, while others feel it is only a sign of deep respect.<br /><br />Despite the inaccuracy (""no literal translation""), the name of the food is apropos to its contents.  They are showing respect to those who suffer gluten sensitivity, and are evoking respect for their product through its name.",4,1
"This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.",4,1
"The ingredients are simple and natural: Wisconsin butter, Salt, Truffle Oil, White Truffles, & Natural Flavorings yet a little of this butter goes a long way to impart an earthly garlicky flavor in your food. Arrives tucked in cold packs and lasts a long time in the freezer. The butter is filled with bits of truffle you can see and taste. I think their secret is whipping truffle oil into the butter to enhance the flavoring. Regardless of the secret, it's a potent and tasty truffle butter.",5,1
"I'd never heard of these things before, but when I saw them in the store over the weekend, I had to try them. I love rosemary, so I got the kind with rosemary in it. It tastes exactly the way I'd hoped it would. Sure, it's expensive, but if you think of it as a gourmet treat as opposed to something you need to have around all the time, $6 isn't bad.",5,1
I am always ordering these snacks. They are totally fruit that is freeze dried. There is no other added ingredient. I used to purchase these at Wal-mart and then they quit getting them. So thankful  for Amazon.,5,1
"I bought this for my wife because she was looking for a change of pace from her usual mandarin orange spice tea. She was disappointed in that the tea had very little discernible cranberry flavor. Green teas are generally much milder (at least to me), but I had to agree that this one is too weak. I love iced green tea with lemon, but I am not a big hot tea drinker. Since you must buy the 2-pack from Amazon, I would suggest you really consider if you want to experiment. We won't be buying it again, but some might like it.",2,0
"I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.",5,1
"I have no idea what the previous reviewer is complaining about but these cookies are simply amazing. I LOVE dark chocolate, and these cookies are just great. I have to limit myself or I'd easily eat the whole package in one sitting.",5,1
"Since I am a fan of flavored coffee, particularly coffee flavored with natural ingredients, I knew I had to try this coffee. As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable. Bottom line: if you enjoy drinking a nice scented coffee, this one is a must-try!",5,1
"Look no further.  Buy this product.  If you have a dog and you have ever been on the other side of trying to give it a pill, only to find it later caked to the floor, or worse, having left you covered in slobber, you will be doing yourself (and your dog) a favor.  These are very malleable, fit almost any size pill, and serve double duty as a treat.  What a concept!",5,1
Always buy this tea because it works and is not crampy like most senna teas.  It also works the same with or without sugar and milk/craem which you do not find in most senna teas,4,1
"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!",1,0
"I hate to leave glowing reviews as it always seems so suspect. However, I enjoy this water very much. It tastes like sweet clay and I feel good after drinking it. I'm used to drinking high pH waters so maybe it was not such a change for me. The only possible drawback to this water is that I have to have it shipped to me (not very green of me) and it's a bit pricey. Great stuff, everyone should try it!",5,1
I really enjoy this product.  Not the usual hot chocolate taste - far more sophisticated.,5,1
"I was concerned about the effect ""regular"" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  ""high-end"" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!",5,1
"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.",1,0

"I have tried a lot cereal claiming healthy, but this cereal is truly one of if not the healthiest.<br />I find the flavor great! The process of creating the cereal is also unlike most that claim healthy.<br />If you eat a lot of processed food and are unsure of what true healthy food taste like because you are use to eating crap you may slam this like the uneducated dog guy.<br />Your eating healthy here. If your use to pork grinds,or lucky charms don't go here, you would be doing your body good.",5,1
"Quajer Oats Squares (especially thr onr with a hint of cinnamon).  I just won't buy another kind of cereal now. Sometimes I eat it for breakfast and dinner, and it's a good source of fiher.  With this cereal you don't lose the crunch before the serving is gono.",5,1
"I first tried Lime Pickle at my favorite Indian restaurant.  I went straight to Whole Foods and bought a jar; however, they stopped carrying it.  I've checked several specialty stores, as well as on line, over the past couple of years and what a nice surprise when I found this on Amazon.  Goes great with chicken dishes, but I served it with a cheese, salami and cracker appetizer and it was a hit.  It has a very strong, unique flavor.",5,1
"We have been receiving the autoshipments for a while now, which is great, but the product we received this time is terrible.  The coffee is not fresh smelling or tasting, and I noticed this morning that the use by date is close.  I'm going to have to toss it and go buy something else.",1,0
Fantastic tea and flavoring.  It's got a zing to it and is great either hot or cold.  Another great STASH brand!,5,1
"We've been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time, but this packaging is an great improvement. We first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder. The grinder was a pain in the wrist to use. I'm so glad that Weber now sells it pre-ground in a shake-on container. Plus, the grill-lid shaped cap is a cute touch. I definitely recommend this seasoning as it's just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal-grilled steak. I'd even use it on chicken or pork, as well.",5,1
"The Pack of 3 arrived but by the look of them they don't seem to be worth the price. A bit pricey, and may as well get mixed nuts from local grocery supermarkets, I thought. Not happy.<br /><br />One of the three packs came half-filled, making it a pouch with less than 5 Ounce of mixed nuts, although the pouch is intact so I guess that was a faulty product. Not happy times 2.<br /><br />One of the two seemingly 10 Ounce pouches has a date-like print ""03 26 13 GB"", but I came across quite a few gone-bad pistachio nuts which you can't tell until you've tasted them. Not happy times 3.<br /><br />Overall, I probably won't buy this again.",2,0
"I received my 35 k-cup sampler today and was pretty happy with the variety, my only complaint is that I didn't get any Apple Cider, I really wanted to try that without having to buy a whole package of it.  But...I got a couple of extras and got a lot of different tea flavors, I love tea so I look forward to trying those, and I did get one iced tea as well.  I would order another sampler from them again!",4,1
"This flavor rocks, as a Blueberry flavor lover this product is entirely up to par, the flavors as rich as blue candy. There is a stigma with this product that it is to be used with lower quality herbs, but i find it is best used to add a fruity blast to already amazing smelling herb blends.<br />If you want to smoke Tasty Puff on a cigarette I would not recommend the flavor Blueberry Thrill, i would recommend the ""Convicted Melon"" flavor. The blueberry IS delicious, but on a cigarette you have to use a lot to get a strong flavor. the watermelon is the strongest of the fruit flavors ive tried, and its amazing at mixing with tobacco flavor; seriously, try it.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting some Tasty Puff, you HAVE to pick up BlueBerry Thrill, it will blow your mind.",5,1
Why are they a dollar more than if I bought the whole box at the liquor store???? We should be getting a better deal buying them in bulk online... In my Opinion...Come on! 20 bucks I'll take it.,5,1
This grass kit is better quality than what I've found in the stores.  The grass is thick and hardy and my cat loves it.  She eats it first thing in the morning and as a snack.  It helps her digestion and she seems more energetic and content.  I ordered 5 of the kits to reduce the shipping costs.  Very happy with this product and highly recommend it.,5,1
"I've heard that this type of treat is very good. Dogs seem to like it and it seems to last a long time. Other than it seeming to taste good, it didn't even last 10 minutes! I have a labradane. She loves treats which doesnt help the fact people says it may or may not taste good. Other than that, this product stinks. I bought it a few days ago and it finally arrived today. I put my puppy in her crate and handed her one of these treats to keep her busy while I pack. This treat was GONE in less than 10 minutes. G.O.N.E gone! Now, its not like my puppy is an aggressive chewer, she just has a strong jaw. She's also a puppy, for those people reading this who have ever had a puppy, they are easily distracted by food.<br />I looked up dog treats for aggressive chewers/strong jawed dogs and this was one of the first 5 items that appeared.I read reviews on it and everyone was crazy about how it was soo good. Now to find that I'm not finished packing, I have to go fill up her KONG to keep her from crying as she sees me running in and out of the room. I do not recommend this unless your dog is old or isnt very interested in dog treats/bones and would rather lay next to you...",2,0
"It must have been around 20 years ago when I was shopping for groceries with my mother, when one of those nice little sample carts was giving out cups of a brand new cereal.  I accepted a cup, and munched as we walked down the next aisle.  Mom asked how I liked it.  I told her that it was different, in a good way, and I really liked it.  Due to my picky tastes when it comes to cereal, she let me go back and pick up a box, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This cereal has been one of my favorites from that day on.  The taste and texture are unlike anything else on the market.  Not to sweet, doesn't get soggy quickly, and I stay full after eating it.<br /><br />The calorie count is a bit high, but thanks to the fiber/protein content, I stay full much better than many other choices.  One serving plus 1/2 cup of skim milk is about 250 calories, so I still have room in a 300 calorie breakfast for some fruit.<br /><br />I'll eat this as a snack sometimes, dry and in smaller quantity, because the crunch is satisfying and the sweet is just enough.<br /><br />The other varieties are also tasty, but the original blue box is still my favorite!",5,1
"This little bonsai has been a real pleasure to own.  Please see pictures I posted to ""customer images"".  I keep this plant outdoors year round with my other outdoor bonsais.

"Our kitty is some what fussy about his treats. He loves these and I have been buying them at the grocery store for around $2 - $2.50 per pouch. We go through a pouch a week, so was very happy to find these on Amazon. The price is great and the quality seems as good as I have seen at our local grocery store.",5,1
"My mom has been using this kit for over 40 years.  The package of spices is the main reason for buying this Kraft product.  She has created many different recipes using the spices.  My favorite is her Shrimp Creole.  The reason I was so happy to find it on AMAZON is because none of the stores in my area sell it any more.  Also, when my mom ordered it from Kraft, they charged quite a bit for shipping and handling.  Your offer is so much better, plus it will arrive every 3 months at a lower price.  Thanks for keeping this wonderful Kraft product in our lives.",5,1
"My daughter was delighted with the lovely bouquet you sent for her birthday. I found it easy to make the transaction, and would use this company again.

"I liked the fragrance, seemed to rinse off the skin, and even liked the micro beads; however, after using it my teenage son started itching and then had acne breakouts.  I itched as well but no acne.  Probably will not use again...whatever chemicals are in this body wash we're having an allergic reaction too.  We don't normally have sensitive skin so that makes me think this product isn't safe for normal users.  I wouldn't recommend.",1,0
This is really good dog food and at a really good price. Way cheaper than at my local pet store. Can't beat this for good value.,5,1
"I can't believe this product has been around for so long and we've only just discovered it now! I opened my first can of Diced Chik last month with a little trepidation after buying it at a local Kosher grocery store for a whopping $5.99 a can. I opened the can, turned to the fridge to get some mayo, and turned around to discover my three kids chowiing it down right out of the can! The taste and texture really are so good that you truly can eat it right out of the can, no sauce, no cooking, nothing! There aren't too many meat substitute products out there that can boast that!<br /><br />In the past month I've used Diced Chik in chili, soup, tacos, omlettes, a pot pie...it's great for kids who may not like the flavor of beef substitute products. I have yet to find anything you can't use it in. For my family of five, we definitely need two cans for dinner. Our brownie troop has several vegetarian girls and we are definitely going to be taking Diced Chik camping with us.",5,1
"I've never eaten Organic Chocolate before, and I often find Dark Chocolate to be somewhat bitter, so I was very interested to taste Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate.

"Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.",5,1
"I first tried this mix about 6 years ago when I lived in Arizona. This is the most amazing margarita mix. It is very natural tasting, not too sweet, and not too tart.<br /><br />In addition to making fantastic Margarita's I also use it as an ingredient for marinating Fajita's; both Chicken and Skirt steak.<br /><br />I could buy this locally in the AJ's stores in Scottsdale. When I moved back to Chicago, I was lucky to find this mix at Cost Plus world markets. Unfortunately, they no longer stock it.<br /><br />I can order on the web, but shipping is a killer, and no free shipping on this.",5,1

"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",1,0

"I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.",5,1
"My 16 month old hates milk.  She did very well on Enfamil Gentleease, so once she turned one, I tried weaning her off of that by mixing it with whole milk, adding more milk and less formula gradually.  Well, she was miserable.  So, I saw this at Target and gave it a try.  She actually claps her hands when I give her this in a sippy cup! I wonder why it is so much cheaper than regular Enfamil, which is at least $26 for the same sized container.  The ingredients are almost identical with the exception of more calcium in this toddler formula.  I will give it to her for a while longer as it contains tons of vitamins, etc. I am glad to find it here with two day free shipping so I don't have to go to Target and risk spending an additonal $150 impulsively!",4,1

The peppermint and spearmint are my favorites and last the longest, the fruit is a little sweet for me and does not last as long.

Sorry - I couldn't use the product because the cover was very loose -the jar appeared to have been opened...wasted money. I also regret that I wasn't able to taste it. I had heard so much about it.<br />I'll never know since I do not plan on reordering.,1,0
"There's such a range with dog treats - you can find those fake bacon treats that are filled with chemicals and then you can find these treats that contain only organic ingredients - no strange chemicals that you can't pronounce. If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.<br /><br />These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can break them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to break them in half). These treats are very hard - so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test - since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon/cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon/cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.<br /><br />For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat.",5,1

I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker and was looking for k-cups when I discovered this.  My daughter is a hot chocolate lover and so I decided to give this a try.  If your coffee machine has different size drink settings use smallest size setting otherwise it is too watery but when done on the lowest size setting it makes a very good cup of hot cocoa.

"I didn't know what to expect from this tea; it is such a delicate and delightful cup.  The bit of half and half I used overpowered the entire cup, but it is so delicious.  Rich and comforting; it tasted like flavored milk.  I think this is one of the best teas i've had in a while.",4,1
If you are looking for something natural to relieve (and possible stop) hot flashes--sage tea will do it. A glass in the morning and one at night and WOW what a difference it made!,5,1
"I love these almonds!  Apparently some reviewers thought these were and should be almond M&M's.  Thankfully, Emerald made these for adult palates, but kids seem to like them too.  The subtle chocolate flavor is wonderful.  The chocolate is roasted onto the almonds and is dry to the touch.  Can't melt and create a mess as milk chocolate does.  A box of 4 canisters didn't last as long as I thought they would.  Amazon has apparently has sold out!  Arghhh!  Do me a favor and buy 300 calorie chocolate bars and leave more of these for me!",5,1
These are pleasantly sweet with a nice vanilla/cinnamon flavor.<br />They are good for eating but not for making pie crusts. I won't<br />be buying them again as they are too expensive for the amount<br />of product you get. Shame because I really liked them.,4,1
"It is getting almost impossible to find stone ground crackers.  If I find them they are too expensive, more than I will pay. Back to Nature Organic Stone Ground Wheat Crackers are good AND come from Amazon at very reasonable price.  I also like the fact that these crackers are pretty nutritious as crackers go.",4,1
I bought this to be part of a care package for my sister who has been struggling with an unknown stomach illness for a couple years now. She says it's one of the few things that helps her to feel better plus gets the nasty taste of the medicine that she's taking out of her mouth.,5,1
"So far, this is the only pre-made graham pie crust that is made without partially hydrogenated oil. It tastes as good as other conventional pre-made pie crust, great with all kinds of non-bake pie recipes.",5,1
This was my first experience with cooking with lavender. That being said it was a good one. The lavender was so fresh and my ice cream came out lovely. I can't wait to try some of the recipes that came with it!,5,1
I used these as a healthier option than chocolate for some cake pops. The yogurt is strong and tasty. I would buy again.,5,1
"I like it much much better than tuna. I've had it in salads, hot dishes, straight out of the can and I love it (for canned salmon recipes see the company's website). I don't mind the skin and bones at all because you can't taste them, but when I'm preparing it for others I just mash the skin and bones with a fork, leaving the bigger chunks of meat intact, and nobody has ever noticed them. The delivery is always quick. I also appreciate the recipes and the postcards with the message from Pre Alaska Salmon Co included in the package. It feels good to always have a few cans of Think Pink tuna in my pantry.",5,1
"I fed my cats Natural Balance because it is good value for good quality. My vet approves it (and she have high fived me before for taking care of the cats so well: wet and dry food, not just dry food).",5,1
"This made in the USA birch derived xylitol is superb.  I love the fact its from an American business.  Xylitol has many benefits and finding it in bulk at a better price than most all suppliers was an added bonus.  Good for your daily diet, good for your teeth, and beneficial in other ways too!",5,1
"This is a very good chilli mix for Cincinnati style chilli.  It reminds me of the great chilli parlors when I lived there. Yummy! Recommend you serve it over spaghetti, topped with kidney beans, green onions and sharp cheddar cheese.",4,1
"I thought I'd order this variety pack as an introduction to Boylan sodas.<br />My thoughts on the flavors.<br />Cream; rather weak taste, I was hoping for more.<br />Ginger Ale; good<br />Root Beer; A good full body taste<br />Orange; Has a strange seltzer-like after taste.<br />Grape; Nice sweet grape flavor<br />Black Cherry; Good flavor",4,1
My vet suggested these chews for my dog's bad breath but he charges more than twice what Amazon offers them for. My chihuahua loves them and  he knows when I go to the kitchen he will be getting his special treat.,5,1
"The dragon pearl tea is a blooming tea. I brew it in the coffee maker, and store it in large canning jars. Sometimes I brew up to six 24 oz jars. I keep them in the fridge and drink them when I am gardening or working around the yard. The crystal rock sugar can be added when you decide to use the brew, not while it is in storage. Jasmine tea gives you energy and it smells incredible!",5,1
"I had tried walnut oil previously but found it a bit overpowering in flavor.  Almond oil is similar, but just a bit lighter in taste, letting the other salad components come through.  Store this is the refrigerator.  Luscious oil, highly recommend.",5,1
"For years Dentyne was the only gum I would ever purchase.  Then it disappeared from shelves everywhere. I tried the new Dentyne, but it's just not the same.  Dentyne should not be in chiclet form. Looked up Dentyne on the internet. Finally found my gum again and will no doubt order again and again.  Still the best gum, no extra added chemicals.  Just a great treat.  Also, will not stick to any dental work so anyone can chew and enjoy.

"This is HORRIBLE! My husband grabbed it from the pantry and said ""what's this""..I said no don't taste it, it is cardboard...he TOTALLY agreed...this does taste like cardboard and is so hard it could break a tooth...unfortunately it went right in the garbage.",1,0
"I have 3 dogs - a Greyhound, a Boston Terrier, and a Rat Terrier mix.  They all love the Purina Beneful Original Dog Food and anxiously will sit and wait for me to serve it to them.  They all have received healthy vet reports, so I know it's good for them.  Of course, I do not overfeed them and exercise them as regularly as possible.  I highly recommend this product.",5,1
"If you love the earthy full flavor of fresh Porcini mushrooms but can't find them (they have a limited Fall season) or just can't afford them fresh or dry (dry can run you $15/oz), this a product worth considering. You can add it to sauces, eggs, & casseroles directly or, as I do mostly, add it to your somewhat flavorless American white mushroom and get a fantastic ""Porcini effect"".  It is essentially a year++ supply of great mushroom flavor for $30 ( cost is dependent on what the on-going sale price is).  You can even buy it and share it with friends (sell or give) and lower the cost - 16oz goes a long way.",5,1
My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.,1,0
"There are not words enough to describe how revolting this vomit-inducing stuff is.  The health benefits I'm sure really are great, but I tried twice to drink this, even in a great smoothie with raspberries, orange and pomegranate juice, and I literally gagged and almost threw up both times.  I think I'll just go back to eating salads and taking vitamins.  Truly, truly horrible stuff.",1,0
"Our local TJ's used to carry these, but no more.  There's a Costco 30 miles away, but that seems too far to travel for a bag of chips.  I finally did the subscribe & save to get them on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I like these chips very much, they have good texture & flavor.  They hold up to dip as well.  I've tried the salt & vineger and the cheese flavors, but plain is still my favorite.",5,1
"This product is overly sweet and has an overpowering 'powdery' vanilla taste to it.  Unfortunately, I had to toss the rest of the bars out.  My daughter took a bite out of one, and she couldn't eat anymore.  They are little bars, so I was surprised.  I gave it a try -- thinking it couldn't be *that* bad -- but, alas, she is right.  Such a waste.",1,0
"Naturade's Bavarian Chocolate flavor is outstanding.  I've been taking this product for breakfast and lunch at work since about September 2005, and I'm not sick of it yet.  Not even close.  I'll consume as much as I want during the day when I want.  I feel completely full for a few hours with one drink. I mix it in a 20 ounce bottle with two scoops.  Your body will appreciate the health benefits of this drink, unlike fried or fast food that will take down your energy level and leave you feeling groggy.  You will lose weight also from taking this product.  I lost 20 pounds and am now at a level of maintaining my current weight, and I owe a lot to Naturade Soy.  I've also tried the Vanilla flavor.  I was not impressed. Buy the Bavarian Chocolate and try it out.  You'll be glad you did.",5,1
Must admit the taste of O.N.E. coconut water is better.  Took a long time to get through the supply of coconut water.,1,0
"I was turned onto these bully sticks by a dog forum I belong to. I have a 12 month old female Labrador that LOVES to chew! She will chew walls, carpet, toys, shoes, wood, ANYTHING! I went to the pet store to find these bully sticks and was shocked at how expensive they are. I bought one and I gave it to my dog and she was completely in love with it! They do have an odor but it is not bad and so worth it to have my very hyper dog occupied with something she loves.<br /><br />Bully Sticks are perfect for long car rides or when you're trying to get a task done at home and you need to keep your dog entertained or just for whatever reason, dogs LOVE them! In fact my dog is chewing on a bully stick as I write this and she doesn't care about anything else except her bull stick! Yes they are an expensive dog treat but they last a long tme and are worth it. Buy these and you will not regret it!",5,1
Ordered the Peanut butter with dark chocolate first and these were exceptionally good.  Then went back and ordered the coconut and almond which was outstanding too!  Put both on auto-shipment so I'm not left without.  Can't believe the awesome price I got too!!,5,1
"This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.",1,0
"I have trouble eating cliff bars & other similar things -- they really upset my stomach. But These kind bars are basically my 3 favorite nuts stuck together with honey etc. Filling, natural food, no stomach issues while hiking.",5,1
"Not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  This root beer tasted fine.  Not the best I've ever had, but husband has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners EXCEPT for Truvia.  He drank most of the 24 pack that we bought and wants me to buy 48 more cans, which I will after I post this.  It's a bit expensive, but the Truvia is worth it for us.",5,1
"I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes ""how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?""  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn.",5,1
Make sure of the quanity when you buy from seller. Product is great but watch out for quanity vs price in add,5,1

"Just be forewarned it is a bit ""moist.""  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)",5,1
"my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed. Everlasting must be a good tasting treat, or perhaps a smaller dog could make it last longer? who knows for sure.  So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time.",2,0
I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.,5,1
"I have dry curly hair.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results I got with this shampoo.  The first thing I noticed was that  a small amount goes a long way which is a plus for me since I usually have to use a lot of shampoo to create a nice lather.  It left my hair soft and manageable.  It softened my hair so much that I was tempted not to use conditioner- which I ALWAYS use - in the end I decided not to push my luck and used my regular conditioner. After I dried my hair it felt clean and soft to the touch.  My husband also commented on how great my hair smelled, so I have no complaints.",5,1
"I love these crackers they are very cheesy, in a good way, and they are easy to eat.  The best way I found to eat these is to get a small bowl of raspberry applesauce and start dipping.<br />Delicious!",5,1
"I am a low carb expert.... eating this way for over 10yrs.  Since I had a carrot cake craving, I ordered.  There's 45 minutes I'll never get back.  I'm not kidding, this actually tasted like barf.  Totally disgusting.  All of mine went in the trash... couldn't even bring myself to feed it to my dogs.",1,0
"A great substitute for pasta. No calories so you can eat all you want. Since they have no flavor of their own, you can season them for Asian or Italian or any seasoning.  I toss in cooked and seasoned shellfish, or chicken, pork or ground beef.",5,1
"In general, I am not a big fan of the recent ""squeeze"" drink concentrate fad. I have found most of them to have a slightly-off, artificial taste (one exception: Mio Sweet Tea). However, I find that ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce"" is the exception to the rule. Vitamin rich, it has a very pleasant taste that belies its sugar-free status.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to take the rating of this product down a notch for its packaging. It is extremely easy to dribble and leak if squeezed in the wrong manner, and the coloring is prone to staining. Also, the bottle size is larger than comparable drink products, such as Mio, meaning that it is not the most portable squeeze drink product around.<br /><br />In all, ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce"" is definitely worth picking up for its taste, which is pretty much the best I've had of its kind. Too bad about the packaging, though.",4,1

"I am a huge Rice Krispies fan, yet try to stay away from non-organic and white rice when there's a reasonable alternative.  I enjoy this every bit as much as the original RK cereal, and am grateful for this product.  It's one of the most innocent ""guilty pleasures"" available in life...  I've tried the gluten-free, and I guess what's missing for me in that version is the flavor imparted by the barley; to me, the gluten-free tastes too bland in comparison with the original version.",5,1
"Great, quick snack for my toddler.  He loves them and I feel ""good"" about giving it to him.",4,1
"I have begged all of the local grocery stores to stock Stash Decaffeinated Green Tea and none of them would. So, I had to get my mother who lives 4 hours away to purchase it from her local store and ship it to me. Then I found that Amazon had it. The price is better and I was told I would receive it in 7 days. I received the package in 3 days. I will order my tea from Amazon from now on. Thanks, Amazon!",5,1
"The Extend ""Chocolate Delight"" bars are probably the best low carb snack bars I have tried since becoming diabetic. While the Atkins bars are generally very good, these taste even better and also do seem to control my blood sugar longer.<br /><br />These bars have 150 Calories each, 12g of Protein, and only 1 Net Carb. The high protein load really helps to control my hunger,  making this a great snack for mid-day munchies or after workout ""pick me up"", as well as a bed time snack.<br /><br />One note of caution, these do have Maltitol which can cause ""gastric distress"" in some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

I purchased mine through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for $8.73 per order *I got 2* 'cause it was such a good price! These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!",5,1

"I've been cutting sugar out of my diet for a few months now.  I've tried several different flavored syrups, and this flavor is the best so far.  It is good in coffee and cocoa and also works well in recipes like pumpkin bread and sweet potato casserole.  It has more flavor ""depth"" than most of the syrup flavors I've tried (vanilla, Irish cream, chocolate) and no after taste.  Definitely a keeper!",5,1
"Never had black rice before.  Heard about the health benefits (higher anthocyanin antioxidants than found in blueberries) and decided to try it.  Nutty taste, delicious and easy to make.

"This is the best invention known to man!!!  Regular peanut butter is loaded with sugar and can really derail you from your healthy lifestyle.  The powdered peanut butter is 85% less fat...all you have to do is mix it with water AND it actually tastes like peanut butter.  Pretty amazing if you ask me.  And at only 45 calories per serving, you can't beat it.",5,1

"After reading the reviews, I was excited to try these bars.  Everyone had positive things to say about this, and all the other flavor larabars.  Unless you love date paste (from the fruit), you will hate these bars!  They are exactly that--chocolate flavored date paste.  They are the worst gluten free food I have ever tried.  I thought that these bars, compared to the fruit ones, would at least be more chocolate-y than fruity.  Nope.  They taste horrific.  There isn't even any positive comment I can make about these bars.  If you like the bars, save your money; buy date paste and just eat it.  GROSS!",1,0
"Best flavor and texture in gluten free oats. Amazon's price is the best. This product is frequently out of stock, probably due to its popularity.",5,1
"The first time I had this tea was at a friend's house when I was out of town and had gotten sick. When I had returned home, I sought it out. I have served it to friends & family and everyone that has tried it loves it. Gentle and special blend of spices. Really delicious with soy or rice milk too.",5,1
"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!",5,1
Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.,4,1

"I bought one package locally for the Price of $1.99!<br /><br />Included in the package:<br /><br />1. Buckwheat Noodle Nest<br />2. Seasoning Flakes<br />3. Broth Concentrate<br />4. Mustard Sauce<br /><br />Microwave directions:<br /><br />1. Put noodles and seasoning flakes in microwavable bowl with 3 cups of water for 6 minutes.<br /><br />2. In a strainer, thoroughly rinse the cooked noodles under cold water and drain.<br /><br />3. Place the noodles in a bowl and pour the prepared broth over it.<br /><br />4. Add the mustard sauce and enjoy.<br /><br />Note this dish has NO MSG (unlike MOST noodle dishes) and NO shrimp and NO pork(unlike some noodle dishes).<br /><br />It is the best tasting instant noodle dish I have ever found. I like the cold noodles and found the overall taste complex yet enjoyable in it's simplicity.<br /><br />I greatly look forward to trying the ""chili sauce"" version.<br /><br />This noodle dish does meet some basic things I always look for:<br /><br />1. NO MSG<br />2. NO Shrimp<br />3. NO Pork<br /><br />Also, this noodle dish far exceeds my expectations of an instant noodle type pre-packaged food product. Once prepared properly it is amazing and does not taste like it came from an inexpensive pre-packaged product.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />1. Yummy! The most Delicious Instant Noodle dish I have ever found!<br />2. Quick and Easy to make - Microwavable!<br />3. NO MSG! NO SHRIMP! NO PORK!<br />4. Very Inexpensive!<br />5. Noodles do NOT stick together (if made properly - RTFM!) ;-)<br /><br />Seeing as how everybody has different taste, I highly suggest you try buying one package first to try it first before buying a package of 20 but this is a ""No Brainer"" and I trust most people have more then a basic average intelligence to know this without being said.",5,1

We have an young and an old Chihuahua and they both like this dog food. Neither of them are jumping with joy over it but they don't mind it at all. The pieces are small and ideal for smaller dogs. Neither of them have ever refused to eat it. Since it has vegetables in it then it should be healthier than some of the other regular dog food on the market. I love the zip-loc style bag so you can leave it right in the bag instead of storing in a separate container. The price is about average so Purina Beneful is a regular for dogs.,4,1
Halo Freeze dried chicken is my cat's favorite thing to eat hands down..It only lasts about a week in my house.,5,1
It feels odd to write a review about Saltines but I found a need for these. I usually get the other size saltines that are bigger but when I saw the smaller size I immediately ordered them. I have had them for a few months now and use them several times a week! I love that you can just put them in a bowl or cup or soup without having to crunch them up first. They are also a perfect snack size to munch on if your tummy is feeling a bit upset or you are on a bland diet. Nabisco has always been my favorite brand for Saltines whether they are the bigger size ones are these. But if I had a choice I would stick to these for the size and convenience. They are very crisp tasting and not too salty. Just the right amount of a saltine cracker to satisfy whatever need it is you have. Highly recommend and will be ordering more!,5,1

"This syrup is indeed sugar-free; unfortunately, it is also pretty much taste-free as well.

"This is a sweet coffee beverage which we tried refrigerated.  We found it tasty, and less sweet than competing brands (Starbucks, Cappio).  Calories are still pretty steep (100 calories for the 8.45 oz can: equivalent to the calories in most sodas), likely owing to the use of dairy.",4,1
"My cat is extremely picky when it comes to treats, so I was leery about whether she would eat these or not.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then one of these, then a couple of hers, then one of these in order to trick her into trying them.  She likes them!<br /><br />After doing this for several different days, I put a pill in one of them.  She is little, so when I put the pill in one treat she chewed it, which is not what I wanted her to do, since she also chewed the pill.  She takes Prednisolone, which apparently has an awful, bitter taste.  So the next time I put the pill in the pocket, closed it and squeezed off all the excess Greenie treat until I got a little ball.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then snuck the pill treat in.  When she started to chew I put another treat in front of her quickly which made her swallow the pill treat whole so that she could eat the next treat.<br /><br />These work great for me!  No more having to sit on top of her, holding her down as she fights me, prying open her mouth and shoving the little pill to the back of her throat, just to have her spit it out so that I have to start the whole process all over again.

"Timothy's Rainforest Espresso is great-tasting coffee; I only wish I could get a full cup.  When I press the start button the flow of water/coffee starts out great, but after a few seconds it drops off to a mere trickle and never (I mean never) fills the cup.  We don't have that type of problem with other K-Cups so I know it's not the coffee-maker.  Thus, I won't be purchasing this brand of coffee anymore.<br /><br />Despite what others have said about buying in bulk, trying to ""trick"" the coffee-maker, etc.; I didn't buy a coffee product to play games with.",1,0
"My husband is the ultimate food snob and I would find him crunching on these biscotti all the time.  Also my daughter would pack these in her lunch, they are not too hard, so you don't have to dip them into coffee, they are perfect.",5,1

"For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.",4,1
"I ordered a case of this water recently and I love it! Give it a try, it tastes great and it comes from a good company too.",5,1
"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was very happy and surprised to even see Kiwi and Strawberry listed. Even though the Strawberry is listed last. Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This sparkling juice did not have an identifiable taste of kiwi or strawberry. You could tell this was a mix of berries that blended the sweet with the tart for a refreshing drink. So it lives up to its name for it is called Kiwi Berry, not Kiwi Strawberry. So I was satisfied with its flavor. I liked the drink and would have more. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories.",4,1
"For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.",4,1

Another brand I use is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038NEOKS"">AdvoCare Spark® Energy Drink (Fruit Punch)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TRN26G"">Advocare Spark Energy Drink Canister (Mandarin Orange)</a>, that is if they have it in stock.

"I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has ""pickyness""/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.",5,1
"The Bar Harbor canned fish products are of the highest quality and offer a great value.  I've had this product, the Cabernet wine sauce and the cracked pepper varieties.<br /><br />Of the three, this is my favorite with the wine sauce a nice second.  The cracked pepper type is essentially this one with black pepper added, which really doesn't work for me (but is still far better than most canned fish).<br /><br />The fish is soft and moist and is not overpowered by any heavy handed oils or weird additives.  Very simple and pure ingredients give it a very clean taste with a wonderful texture.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!",5,1
"My mother was not a master chef.  We had our fair share of home-cooked meals growing up, but they were all quite basic.  When I grew older and finally left the house, I would return on occasion, and would be asked what I wanted her to make for me.  The answer was almost always the same, pancakes and homemade syrup.  The pancake recipe was I think out of a Swedish cookbook, and I have yet to have a tastier pancake at a restaurant (made best with spoiled milk, trust me).  And the syrup?  Made with Mapleine, the first recipe.  I sometimes seriously consider taking this syrup with me when I go out for breakfast.<br /><br />My mother passed away earlier this year after a long fight with leukemia.<br /><br />This last Sunday, using my mother's hand-written copy of the recipe and the bottle of Mapleine my father gave me for my birthday (he's not dirt poor or anything, it was one gift among a much bigger gift...but he knew I would appreciate it), my wife and I made a batch of pancakes and syrup.  My wife does not cook much, but was sure to follow the directions as well as possible while I made the syrup.  Upon putting the two together for the first time in a great while, it took about 30 seconds to sink in, and I burst into tears.<br /><br />Our first born will be arriving in a couple of months.  And you best be sure the first solid he's going to get is Grandma's pancakes.<br /><br />And now I hear it's getting harder to find Mapleine.  As soon as I'm done with this review, believe me I'm going to find out why, and order as much as I can.",5,1
"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",5,1
"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies.",5,1
My Pit Bull adores these Darford treats and other treats from Darford as well.  I have bought a bunch of these and given them to other dogs in the family and they go wild for these too.  Sometimes I have to break it in half for my dog or he just walks around with the whole bone in his mouth.  This is a large bone I and dont see an issue with giving half at a time for a treat.  Your dog will love you forever if you get them this.,5,1
"I love ginger ale, and this Blenheim's is by far the best I've tasted. It's dryer than other sodas, so there's no cloying sweetness; the ginger flavor is complex/multi-layered, and while this particular level of ""hotness"" will make you cough, if you breathe in right when you take a drink, I wouldn't describe it as challengingly spicy. If you're familiar with this soda, and are considering ordering this pack of 12 bottles from Amazon, the bottles we received had gold caps (not red, as in the item photo). This is the medium hotness level for this brand. Cheers!",5,1
Have enjoyed many cups of this flavorful tea which was first given to me by a friend.  I have continued to order it on a regular basis.,5,1
"After doing some research, I've decided to try the Starbucks VIA Columbia instant coffee because of it's high reviews. Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried. I haven't tried that many to be sure but with many of the other brands, you can definitely tell that you were drinking cheap instant coffee. Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively. I'm not really a coffee snob and so there's not much bad to say in the taste department.<br /><br />Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, it can be a hassle sometimes to grind the beans and use my french press. For those times when I'm feeling especially lazy, I can now count on brewing a cup of this instant coffee. No mess to cleanup and it tastes great as well. What more can you ask for in a instant cup of coffee?!",4,1

Usually I'm leery of cheap bulk food but this cheese tortellini wasn't half bad.  The quantity for the price is stupendous and the main thing I'll say is that you should transfer it to sealed containers so its interaction with ambient oxygen supplies is limited.  Why?  Because there's so much that unless you're feeding a crew of Vikings it'll last a very long time.<br /><br />It's not as good as real fresh pasta but it's a much better deal and it lasts a whole lot longer.  Recommended.,4,1
"I have to say that the Stinger Waffles are the best energy snack to come on the market in years.  I love these things.  I cycle, and the fact that these are flat make them really easy to carry in a jersey pocket.  They don't have huge amounts of calories, but they definitely help me keep going during a long workout.  And they taste so good, that I keep them around as regular snacks, even when I am not exercising.<br /><br />The only downside to these (and the reasons they get 4 stars): the packages aren't the easiest to open.  I usually only open them when stopped if it is during a ride.  If I could give half-stars, these would be 4.5!",4,1
Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila!,4,1
Very good snack sticks.  It does not feel greasy like Slim Jims and is easy to chew.  The size is perfect for a snack so I don't eat too many all at once.  I prefer it to be a little bit spicier though but they don't come in this size and price.  This is good if you have a craving for protein and should help hold off the hunger between meals.,4,1
"Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.",4,1

"It's difficult to know how to rate this product as I have to confess, despite my personal pledge never to review a book I haven't read or a product I haven't used, I wasn't willing to try these dog treats and even if I would, I wouldn't have enough experience with other treats to make a fair comparison.  (OK, there was that one incident in college involving <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633TU4"">Milk-Bone Large Original Dog Biscuits</a> but the less said about that, the better!)<br /><br />So, in this age of high technology what better way to test something than to send it out to ""the lab"".  Of course in this case, it's a 70 pound Yellow English Labrador Retriever named Casey, but you get my point I hope.<br /><br />The results are in and ""the lab"" approves.  The size of the treats are smaller perhaps than what a larger breed would normally want, but there's nothing wrong with doubling up for them.  The aroma of the treats were enough to send Casey into a full cycle of sit, stay, lay down, roll over and shake hands and to hold her attention during training and normal rewards.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient and resealable.  A good product experience and I would consider purchasing them again in the future.<br /><br />5 barks!<br /><br />Bart Breen",5,1
"I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.",5,1
"SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!",1,0
"I offered these to my cat, but she wouldn't touch them. She loves other treats. She even gets excited when I feed her ordinary kibble by hand.

"This is the best of its kind I have tried: a prepared coffee beverage. It isn't too acidic, and has a nice rich coffee flavor. It is, of course, not hot unless you leave it in the car or heat it up somehow (Starbucks had some deal that was self-heating a while back, but I think it is no longer available.) It is not overly sweet, but is somewhat so--it has 50 calories, so that's a couple of teaspoons of sugar. I would prefer an unsweetened option, but this is not too much. You could easily make iced coffee with this--it has enough flavor to hold up to some dilution from the ice and could be pre-chilled to reduce that even further.<br /><br />Good stuff.",5,1
On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.,1,0

"Lately I have been suffering from dry scalp. So when this product was offered, I thought that I would give it a try. After all, I had nothing to lose. What I found was a product that I liked. First, I love the easy to use applicator. Once open, you can part your hair and apply the oil to your scalp, not your hair. After applying a small amount, which was super easy with this applicator, to those areas on my scalp that felt a little dry and itchy, I simply massaged my scalp and styled my hair. Secondly, I didn't find it to be too greasy, but maybe that was because I was placing the product directly to the scalp and not to the hair itself. Third, I didn't mind the smell. Unlike some who have reviewed this product, I didn't find it too overwhelming (it is tropical smelling), but again I was only placing a small amount on the scalp. Finally, I found the product to be affordable and comparable, especially when compared to other hair oils. Overall, I thought this product did exactly what it said it would...it provides nourishment to dry itchy hair. I give it a 4.",4,1

"I know, I know: ""real"" restaurants frown upon this. You can't even get it at Outback, at least not around where I live. They consider it more like cheap condiment than real steak sauce. But I like it; it's got a tad of zing, and it goes with so much more than just meat. You can add some more heat if you want - just stir in what you want. I say sauce the way you want to. This quantity and size of bottles is the only way to go, and it compares very favorably to supermarket prices, given no tax or shipping.",5,1
"Amazing...I am not usually an almond person unless they are smoked an toasted.

I live just far enough away from stores to make this a cost effective method of buying this spread.<br />i hope this isn't another product that I really like and then they quit making it. my recomendation is to get it now and try it..it is amazing, who knew that something so good for you could taste this good as well.",5,1

"I have a large Sprout Master. I purchased it when I first got interested in sprouting based on great feedback. But sometimes it seemed like too much. Since there are only two of us, I used the divider and sprouted two different kinds of seeds at once. Yet, it still was more than I could use in a week. Then I came across the mini sprouter! How cool is this? Each tray has a divider so if I want, I can actually sprout 6 different types of seeds at once. They stack on top of each other and take up such a small footprint on my counter. Even better, is that someone asked me to sprout some seeds for them and I was able to give them the ""layer"" with their seeds already sprouted and ready to finish crisping in the fridge. When they are done eating them, I will take the layer back and begin another sort of seed. The mini is the perfect size for one or two people. The larger is great for families or sharing. Quality construction, easy to clean and again, each has a divider you can use or take out when not needed. This would be a great gift with organic seeds for a newlywed couple or someone wanting to bypass the store purchased sprouts that are causing many health problems. I heard Kroger is no longer selling sprouts at all. Eat healthy and use a no fail product to sprout. This fits the ticket.",5,1
I a saw this reviewed on Dr. Oz's program where he pointed the health benefits for using this oil.  I tried it and was exceedingly pleased with it.  When you use it for frying it does not have an oily taste and is not drenched with oil like other oils.  Has a neutral taste. I recommend everybody to try it and make their own judgement. I am sure that they will not be disappointed.,5,1
"I have a farm and one of my dogs is a service dog doing mobility work for me.  Our farm is literally on a mountain. It's really hard to keep weight on the working dogs, much less my youngster who ALSO goes everywhere with me with a backpack constantly balancing my weight! We have used this food for a couple of years now. I understand it is used by some mushers (sled dog trainers). Given the choice I honestly would use some of the higher quality diets. Every few months we get a batch that seems to make a few of my more sensitive dogs slightly under the weather. Diamond (rolling eyes). Overall, however, this is a far,  far better food than most grocery store brands, ANYTHING I have ever seen at Walmarts, and better bang for your buck on calories per dollar (do the math sometime, it's very revealing with regard to some of the ""cheap foods"").",5,1

"I have been purchasing these chews for our two American Eskimo dogs (miniature and a toy) for years. My dogs really enjoy them, as soon as I go for the package they become excited. One thing to watch out for: particularly thick chews. Usually there are 2-3 chews that are thicker than the rest and very hard. I didn't catch this and one of my dogs broke one of their teeth on it. I still buy them, but I go through the entire bag and remove the thick ones.",5,1
"Great stuff, very transportable and easy for those on the go! I did remove the small package in the bottle to keep moisture out and I really shouldn't have.

"These are some of the best olives I have ever tasted! I purchased them recently from Gristede's and literally had to go back two days later for another jar. The olives are big, yummy, perfectly brined, not too salty queen olives in a smooth, dry vermouth that yes - gave me a bit of a buzz even before I mixed it with gin to create a tasty martini. The only thing that kept me from clearing the supermarket shelf of these olives was the cost - in store they're $6.99 and it was a good distance from my Brooklyn address. I took it as a sign that the Universe was trying to help me manage my olive addiction. I almost opened the second jar on the subway - I need help and olive lovers you need to try these olives.",5,1
This is the only bone my dog will eat.  Yes she is spoiled but I never knew I could only get one certain kind of bone.  So my dog is the poster dog for Nutri Dent dog chews.  I just hope they never discontinue them.  Great product and I am glad to find a bone chew my dog likes.,5,1
I stumbled across this Chili and glad I did. Great with Ball Park Deli Style dogs that just came out.,5,1
"I'm sure this was intended for hard cases who want to pretend they are drinking real cocktails but this is a weak effort.  It does indeed remind one of margarita mix, the nasty commercially made chemical laden stuff served cheap mexican restaurants.  Obviously Crystal Light is a 100% artificial product but it does not need to taste this bad.  OTOH, if you like choking down weak bad margaritas without the benefit of getting a buzz then have at it.",1,0
"Velveeta Cheesy Skillets are fast and easy to prepare.  Just add chicken according to the package directions and you have an easy skillet meal of chicken and cheesy pasta with broccoli.  You only have one pan to clean up, which is an added bonus.<br /><br />This skillet entree is also customizable.  My family likes to add more broccoli, and we even talked about adding other vegetables and meats to the dish.  It is a tasty meal that is quickly and easily prepared with minimal cleanup.  Yum!",4,1
"I prefer the red quinoa to the more common variety (white? brown? beige? golden?), or you can mix them for an interesting color combination.  If you use no more than half of the other quinoa, the taste is almost the same.  It's really easy to cook quinoa in the rice cooker:  1-1/2 cups of quinoa to 2 cups of liquid (water, chicken broth, etc.); add a little salt if you like and v&oacute;ila!  A delicious breakfast or a side dish for dinner.<br /><br />You can get the more common color to mix when you cook: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE"">Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa, 26-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>; Eden Organic Quinoa, 16-Ounce Package (Pack of 5); Arrowhead Mills Quinoa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6); <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKUTLE"">Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa, Traditional, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5IF8E"">Melissa's Quinoa South American, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>",5,1

There is no flavor or sweetness lost in this fat-free hot cocoa mix. There are ONLY 20 calories contained in each packet. The cocoa doesn't have a fake taste or lackluster aftertaste. It's honestly one of the best low-calorie hot cocoa drinks  I've ever had. I have yet to find a hot beverage that tastes this good and is only 20 calories...,5,1
"I love having these on hand.  It is a necessity when you are out and about and run out of formula or weren't expecting to need some and have a back up packet in your purse.  I also really like having them for airplane rides, easier when you have less space.  Very much worth the cost of having them packaged like this.",5,1
bought this expecting a good rich chocolate flavor. terribley disappointed. tasted like chocolate flavored perfume. wouldn't recommend this to anyone. would rate this 0 if i could,1,0
"I'm vegan and have been craving some yummy mac n cheese for some time. After reading such good reviews about Amy's frozen vegan mac n cheese, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some. However, when I finally did try it I was pretty disappointed in the artificial taste and ooey gooey (in a bad way) texture. This is coming from someone who normally likes Daiya cheese. WTH?<br /><br />A week or so later, I saw this Mac & Chreese at my local Wholefoods and despite feeling really skeptical after my last experience, I bought some.<br /><br />For the milk, I used plain, unsweetened almond milk and a bit of earth balance butter and an extra special ingredient, mustard! Just a little gives a very cheddary taste. I was surprised! It seemed a bit garlicy, but I didn't mind, I like garlic! I'm craving it again right now. Next time I might try it baked with extra cheese and bread crumbs.<br /><br />As for the texture, it was pretty spot on for me. Very cheesy. Also, it's WAY cheaper than Amy's icky mac. Yay!",5,1
"the best part was the white chocolate, but you can buy that anywhere for cheap<br /><br />this crap crumbles into thousands of pieces when you take a bite, so you can't even anywhere with you. Gotta eat it over the kitchen sink as it is so messy<br /><br />avoid this at all costs. Buy the chewy counterpart instead",1,0
"A little expensive, but theses pouches are great on the go. They are BPA free and all organic. My daughter wouldn't eat the jar food (peas, carrots, etc.), but when mixed with fruit she will. Great product!",5,1
"The one downside to the single serve coffee maker is that you cannot make your coffee stronger/weaker. Well I found that with this blend of coffee it gets much more bold than other brands. I like my coffee bold and this one is perfect for me.  I do wish that these single serving size cups were cheaper but other than that this product is excellent, great flavor with good boldness.",5,1
"I was happy to find the large quantity barrels because I have friends and family that like pork rinds I knew they would be gobbled up, the price was not such a break from the smaller packages you get in the store but the quality and quantity was there and that what I was looking for.",4,1
Jack Link's beef jerky is a quick and great tasting way to get extra protein into your diet.  A great snack.  I really like the teriyaki flavor.,4,1
Just remember you need to buy a Kit to make it in.<br />Save your old bottles.<br />Very Easy,4,1
"This product is a great one for someone obsessed with sweets, their weight, AND their health!<br /><br />These lollipops are ridiculously delicious, not too high in calories (23 calories, and they last for around 20 minutes) and organic.<br /><br />This is such a great value. I tried some YummyEarth products, then went for sugar-free hard candies from Crystal Light, and found myself back at YummyEarth for more. Whatever, whatever. This is a good product. Buy it.",5,1
"Who would've thought a snack that is not bad for you, could taste so good.  Both my husband and I really enjoy these.",5,1
"I've tried four or five different brands and Dirty Sue is clearly the best. Darker and 'brinier' than others. Very authentic flavor, nothing artificial here. Pricier too; in fact its at the top of it's price point and if it goes up, I go elsewhere.  Then again, if you are using good gin and vodka, you want your dirty martini just right.",5,1
This didn't last more than a couple of days.  My 30 lb. Brittany destroyed it.  I got a Kong to replace it and it's MUCH sturdier!,2,0
"I have used these cat chews for a year now. I give our kitty one in the morning and one in the evening. They have done wonders for the teeth!<br /><br />Last year, our cats teeth were so bad that she had to have one extracted when she had her teeth cleaned. This year, her teeth looked so good the vet said they didn't even need a cleaning. Vet had told me they worked but I can now attest to that, first hand!<br /><br />The bonus is ... she loves them!",5,1
"Out of all of the natural sodas I love this one. The taste is great!!! It taste more like the soda it represents, which is root beer. I have tried the diet cola, and the one that is supposed to be like the Dr. Pepper and this one has the closest taste.",5,1
"I have a half Pomeranian and half Chihuahua. He has a tiny mouth, and he loves these Nutri Dents.

"Not quite the texture of pasta, but was still very good.  Since pasta does not have a flavor anyway, it just took on the flavor of the sauce and tasted the same.  I would recommend to anyone who does not want the heaviness of pasta.",4,1
"If you want to eat a lot for only a few calories these are great. However the sea salt flavor is very bland and has essentially no flavor. They also stick to your tongue in a weird way because they're so porous. I think maybe the cheddar flavor could be ok but the three in this variety pack didn't impress me.

"In my search for a toy that would occupy & challenge my 2-year-old Golden Retriever, I located the Tug-a-Jug.  Like one of the other reviewers, at first my dog was not entirely convinced that the toy was his to play with, as he had never been given access to a bottle before.  After the scent of the treats lured him in, he began to play.  It took little time for him to realize that the rope was what was getting in the way of the treating plopping out, so he just set about chewing on the rope until he succeeded in chewing it in half.  After this happened, the shorter knotted end fell into the jug, and the treats came out easily.  Now I am left with an -a-Jug, as the ""tug"" is missing.  We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.  I'm hoping to find a replacement rope to string through the jug, however they are often knotted so tightly, I've not yet had any success there.  Overall, a great toy that continues to entertain my dog, despite the fact that he re-engineered the main mechanism in the first 30 minutes.",5,1
I've been using Stevia for more than 10 years.  And I particularly love the Apricot fragrance because it cuts the sweetness a little and gives drinks a little tang.,5,1

"I have two kittens both male persians.  I've been trying different brand kitten foods, including fresh, canned, and dry.  Of all the dried types I have purchased, they like this brand and the Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula.  Each piece of food is small and bite sized for my kitten's little mouths.  Each of my kittens are less than a year old. I like how Hill's uses a portion of the price I paid for this food and donates it through their Shelter Nutrition Partnership.  I'm willing to pay a little more money for the kitten food knowing that a portion is donated to help animals have a more balanced nutrition.  I will purchase this brand again.",5,1
I was very happy with my product. It was shipped very quickly and packed well.  I saved a lot of money on this product too because the canned vegetarian products are only sold at one store within a 40 mile radius of my house and they rape you on the price!!  (around 7-8 dollars per can),5,1
"WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.",5,1
"Snyder's are the best quality pretzels, in my opinion.  The fact that they have been around for 100 years speaks for itself.<br /><br />Also as a retail convenience store I get my supply from Amazon because the price is right.  On Subscribe and Save I make over 40% at retail price as oppose to the 25% I use to with a local middle man distributor.",5,1
Good cookies; but too expensive now. I used to buy them a couple of years ago and they were $10 less. I think they're too expensive now.,4,1
Bought this for my husband who loves everything spicy.  He absolutely loved this jerky.  The only problem was he ran out!,5,1
This coffee is delicious and a great price too!!!  It is  second only to Island Coconut. I will keep buying both of them for sure.,5,1
This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.,1,0
"My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.

Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.",5,1

"My little yourkie absolutely loves these treats. He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.<br /><br />GREAT product, but the packaging wasn't too great. The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning.",5,1
"Hansen's sodas are great - flavorful and crisp tasting, especially when you take your time and drink it slowly.  It'd be great if Amazon let you mix and match six-packs in a case.",5,1
"These beef jerky strips are really good.  Texture is just right.  Flavor is peppery, but also just right.  Could be more smoky for me.  This is a repeat buy on my part.",4,1
"With the new fad of making sodas that are good for you too, we have plenty to choose from in the drink isle. Switch's Orange Tangerine has a great taste, a fruity nose and is refreshing. But with the same calorie content [140] as a can of Coke - well, I'm sticking with Coke. Had Switch produced this product calorie-free like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00247D46E"">Nutrisoda Immune, Tangerine & Lime, 12Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> it would gain a greater market share with established soda drinkers.

"Everyone that tried this coffee really enjoyed it. It has a great smooth taste, and you can clearly taste the chocolate. I usually don't have more than one cup of coffee at a time, but I couldn't help having more of this. Even people that weren't big fans of chocolate liked it.<br /><br />It's flavored naturally and artificially, which is the only reason it lost points for me. I don't like when products use artificial flavoring.",4,1
"I have had this coffee on the Amazon reorder program every month for some time now.  I love the program, for I am never out of the best coffee you can buy, especially if you like a bold dark coffee. Emeril is true New Orleans Flavor.",5,1
"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.",5,1
"I'm very pleased with my Yogi Tea order - it arrived at my door perfectly packaged 3 days after my order. Using the subscription service, I saved over $15 from what it would cost at my Whole Foods.

I love having the benefits of green tea and kombucha with a mild, sweet, very tasty flavor - Having a cup in the AM immediately makes me feel better. Thank you Yogi & Amazon!",5,1
"I thought I ordered a bold decaf but this is what was delivered.  I opened one to try it out and do not like it but am now stuck with it because I opened the box.  This product needs to be labeled properly and CLEARLY.  If you like a mild roast, this is for you.",1,0
"We've used this before and love the taste of it. It goes well with french toast, waffles or pancakes. I've also made cookies with it and they were great, too. I even put a little on my unsweetened shredded wheat. We never use sugar anymore for anything! Try it; it's organic, low glycemic, and delicious. What more can you ask?",5,1

"I've never tried Gevalia Coffee and I won't ever purchase it again.  Back in the mid-80s the Superfresh stores sold a premium vanilla almond coffee that was out of this world!  It was whole bean coffee and included almond slices in with the beans. The brewing aroma filled the room and the flavor was wonderful. The company went out of business and I've been trying to find that coffee ever since.  This was my latest attempt. Gevalia might claim this coffee is vanilla almond but they could call it any other name -- it has no extra flavor.  You can't smell vanilla almond when you open the bag, you can't smell it while it's brewing and you certainly can't taste it.  It tastes like stale coffee. That's it. This is a very fine grind, almost powdery. If you have a machine that clogs with with finely ground coffee, look elsewhere. And if you want the aroma and flavor of vanilla almond, keep looking.  It isn't here.",1,0

I have a 7 yr old w/food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these.  I have compared to several other cookie/snack items made with no dairy & eggs and I think we all liked these the best.  Definitely a must have for restricted diets.,4,1
"An elderly man (98) that I cared for ate these in his oatmeal w/ flax seed EVERY morning. Our local grocery stores quit carrying the ""raspberry"" fruit, so I ordered him cases from Amazon whenever his stock was low.  Personally, they are mushy and juicy compared to fresh berries, but they were the only kind he ate.  He died at age 99, and ate them for the 4 years I cared for him.",5,1
Incorrect item sent to gift recipient which necessitated repackaging the item and traveling to a post office.<br />Poor customer service.,1,0
"I have two extremely aggressive chewers, a Lab and a Dalmatian....and this bone keeps them busy for DAYS.  You do have to watch when the smaller top bones separate from the rest of the bone as they are chewed, they could be a choking hazard.  The Sarge keeps both of my dogs interested, even when the marrow and tendons have long since been eaten.  Great value for the price, considering they last so long.  If you want a bone that stimulates and satisfies, this is it!",5,1
"GoPicnic is a great organic alternative to fast food on the go.<br /><br />The meal in each package consists of four parts:<br /><br />The chili-lime salmon spread and crackers, a fruit & nut mix containing ginger peanuts, cranberries, and banana chips (though ours only contained one chip), dry roasted edamame, and a dark chocolate square.<br /><br />This was surprisingly filling, quality food.  My body even felt good after eating, so I know it wasn't cleverly-disguised junk.  My children enjoyed the chocolate, salmon spread and crackers (Ritz-like, but organic). We all agreed that the dark chocolate didn't have the strong, bitter after taste we've found with other dark chocolate varieties. I preferred the dry roasted edamame & dried fruit & nut mix.  I found the salmon to be too watered-down (I'm more of a chunky spread person).  I couldn't taste the salmon enough over the chili-lime, but the children disagreed (they don't like chunks).<br /><br />This ready-to-eat meal is nutritious, well packaged (brightly-colored wrapping, includes Sudoku grid in each box) and tasty. This is great for traveling in the car with my children, who usually want to stop off for fast food (it has the Lunchable-type appeal to kids).  It is a bonus that we can eat out of the same box-less waste and I don't go hungry (also curbs my ravenous sugar cravings)!<br /><br />As a health conscious mom, I am satisfied.",4,1
Very good and filling to have at home as a snack or on the go when I don't have time to cook.,5,1
"I overlooked the word ""Glaze"" prior to purchase, and was pleasantly surprised at how thick it was. Maybe a bit too strong for my taste, so I usually use it with a touch of fresh lemon or lime juice.",4,1
"Kellog's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal is chocolate, crunchy and satisfying. I liked it with soy milk or almond milk, but plain old cow juice would be fine. It has a light, crisp texture and a real chocolate flavor. For me, it's probably better for that late-night craving even than for breakfast, but a bowl of chocolate crunchy stuff, milk and a piece of fruit wouldn't be a bad start for any old day.",4,1
I love Haribo products. The licorice is harder to find. The price was great. The product was fresh and arrived very quickly. Now I'm in licorice heaven.,5,1
"I really enjoyed this product but I don't drink it according to the instructions.  I add more mix than instructed and I also add about a tablespoon of sugar alcohol when I make a batch.  It gives the drink a smoother sweetness than without it.  As for the strawberry flavoring, it taste more berry than strawberry.  A warning, when making a virgin margarita use less ice and expect a change in the quality of sweetness.  It's still good but loses some of that smooth sweet flavor and you get a little bitterness",4,1
"I'm not a dried cherry connoisseur, but these are EXCELLENT. Sweet, a little tart, chewy, not oily, and VERY cherry without tasting artificial at all. As far as dried fruit goes, these are GREAT. I'd buy these again definitely, and at the just-under-20-dollar price I got them for, 5 dollars for a pound of a delicious, sweet, and healthy all-natural snack makes it quite the bargain!",5,1
"This gum is really quite refreshing! It's delightfully sour and sweet at the same time, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it like some Western sweets.",5,1

IHAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE I CAN CONTROL WHAT IS IN MY SODA AND THIS SYRUP IN THE BEST.,5,1
I fiddled with the recipe on the canister and found that the liquid must be buttermilk although buttermilk powder is one of the ingredients and that butter not oil must be used to make these waffles worth eating in my family.  They're fantastic.  Waffles and pancakes are basically delivery systems for butter.,5,1
"Received the box and all the coffee was intact and tasted wonderful. My husband loves this coffee. He is only allowed 'decaf' for medical reasons, and he absolutely thinks Timothy's is the greatest. No bitterness, just pure, smooth coffee.<br />What can I say but 'thank you' for great service, great product and reasonable price.<br />Will probably buy from them again.",5,1
"i bought these as a christmas gift for my son. i read one review that mentioned how the cherry flavour tasted like cough syrup and i have to agree. i'm an idiot for ignoring that review because i had a feeling that person would be right. i'm returning them on monday, i can't imagine the rest of them tasting any better when they all have the same ingredients. i got these because they would make for instant sno-cones whenever my son or his friends wanted them (rather than waiting for me to make a syrup) but i'm just going to plan ahead or something and make syrups. i can't feed this to my son or anyone else's child in good conscience. while they are nice & thick, that cherry flavour left such an unnatural and chemical taste in my mouth that i can't justify keeping them. for $60 original price, i expected MUCH more. if you do buy them (and i wouldn't recommend it) be sure to get those black bottle caps for them so you can regulate how much comes out.",1,0
"Most of the Gloria Jeans coffees I've tried do not meet my coffee expectations. Some of the foo foo flavors, like Mudslide, are okay, but still not exceptional. Luckily, I was able to trade my almost full box at the K-Cup Exchange on yahoo ([...]), and in return get a flavor I liked.<br /><br />I recommend this site VERY highly. You will learn a lot about brewing with your Keurig there, and it's free.",2,0
The instant Ginger Honey Crystals are great. I love them. When I feel like a cold is coming on I have a hot cup and it works wonders and makes me feel better.,5,1
I like strong coffee and Dark Magic is pretty close to what I like. I am also using San Francisco Bay French Roast both are full bodied with little bitter after taste. If you like Starbucks Blonde or Pikes Place these are not the coffees for you.,4,1
"When I found the shelves at Costco empty and complained to the checkout cashier she smiled and informed me that Costco will carry this wonderful product during the spring and summer months only. Sure enough, it's now March and I found it there last week! What a relief.... I think they have it wrong though, it should be on available year round, and certainly during the fall and winter when comfort foods such as chili are frequently on the supper menu. On another note: if you want to enjoy it even more, try baking it the way the Southern grandmother would: simply add an extra couple of tablespoons of oil to a heavy cast iron skillet, place it in the oven while it is heating up, remove hot skillet and pour in the cornbread batter. You should see the oil go up the sides and sizzle a bit. Bake for about 35-40 minutes as directed. This extra oil and hot skillet method creates a very "" crispy "" bottom and side crust (not to mention a few more calories, but you want to be authentic, right ? ) Serve with some cooked greens such as swiss chard, kale or collards.... dee-licious!!  You can also have more cornbread for breakfast the next day if there is any leftover, which is unlikely.",5,1
"They are delicious, taste like regular candies but it can be dangerous! If you eat too many, your stomach could deny. And it will be stomach upset big time. So be cautious and eat them in reasonable amount :) It should be 5 stars bit -1 for stomach problems.",4,1
"If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5,1
"If you are tired of food that is loaded with ingredients you cannot pronounced or possibly even digest, you should give the Larabar Food Bar a try.  Five ingredients:  dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon and clove.  Nothing more and nothing less and the amazing bonus ... they taste good!  No added sugar, 6g of fiber and sodium free ....almost unbelieveable isn't it.",5,1
One of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one.  Almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting.,4,1
The taste of the coffee was very bitter and smelled horrible.  Though the capsule concept is more convenient the product quality has to deliver and this does not at all meet expectations.  The flavor was 'off' and tasted under-roasted and foul.,1,0
THIS COFFEE IS PERFECT FOR ME. BEFORE I GOT THE K-CUP COFFEE MAKER I ENJOYED STRONG COFFEE.  I TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF K-CUPS AND ALWAYS GO BACK TO THIS ONE.  IT HAS GOOD FLAVOR AND STRENGTH TO SATISFY ME.,5,1
This is a quality product. Our chihuahua loves it! Finally a  dog food that we can tell what is in it just by looking at it!,5,1
I have a son with multiple food allergies so I was very excited to find this product.  Both of my children (the other has no allergies) love the taste and it's much healthier than most granola bars available.,5,1
"This item was listed under the gluten-free products and is absolutely not gluten-free.  Luckily I opened a bag and gave it to my one son that does not have the allergy before I realized this mistake.  Please, Amazon, remove these products from that catagory.",1,0
I was hunting for Gen Mai Cha when I stumbled upon another tea made buy the same manufacturer. I never had Hoji tea before. I knew from reviews of it that it was a golden colored tea. That it is. It was a blend of some odd stuff to me but that is the nature of tea blends. Hoji tea has a very unique flavor I never had before. Now the Genmai Cha made by SA is off the hook. This tea likewise is an excellent compliment for some meals. I would find it a prefect counterbalance to Teriyaki dishes. I would even drink this while eating tempura. It has a strange smoky woody taste. It is not bitter at all either like conventional tea can be. Some people say it has a seaweed like smell to it but this brand has a smell that reminds me of a field that has been burned and tilled for the next season's planting. It is not a smokey smell per say but a earthy smell. There is no chlorophyll like tinge of a cut grass field to this tea. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I can say for myself this is another very high quality product. It is not as expensive as Gen Mai but for those needing something different tea wise I would recommend giving this a spin! If other Hoji teas let you down this one will not!<br /><br />This was a remarkable introduction to Hoji tea for me! I think a lesser product would have not done it for me!,5,1
"I was a kid when Boboli was first introduced (at least to the local market). Yet somehow decades passed and I never tried them. So this weekend when I had some leftover cheese and sauce from a pasta dinner, and saw these in the market, I thought, ""perfect"".<br /><br />The experience was anything but.<br /><br />I don't know what these are supposed to taste like, but I found them to be just awful. Once cooked, they're thick and doughy. Nothing at all like actual pizza crust. Not NY Style, Chicago style or California. Worse still, they have this god awful rancid oil taste. Like used, dirty oil from a cheap take out place.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will not be using the 2nd one that came in the package. Nor will I be purchasing these again.",1,0
"One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C15JCU"">Kingdom Pets Premium Dog Treats, Chicken Jerky, 48-Ounce Bag</a><br /><br />I purchased this product at Costco and gave my 8 lb toy fox terrier one.I would like to mention that I gave her one that was much larger in size than normally.  Two days later my dog was diagnosed with high toxic levels within her liver and also has pancreatitis. Have no idea if she will make it. I just got off the phone and they assured me that their product is safe and harmless to animals...REALLY.............REALLY...... They told me that their product would never effect the animals liver.

"I advise to take a look at the ingredients in this tea. I believe there are licorice and fennel seeds, among other things.<br /> When I drank it the first time, it was just yucky. The second time, I tried mixing it with black tea and I just couldn't handle it.<br />I have no idea if it helps breathing because I cant get through a cup of it.<br /><br />I will, however, mention that other Yogi teas are great (my favorite is the Vanilla Spice energy).",2,0
"ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that ""bitter"" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks",5,1
"I gave up diet Coke several years ago in favor of filtered water but sometimes I just wanted something--else.  I'm not an alcohol drinker or juice drinker.  Plus I can't handle citric acid in any quantity.  So, with summer s-l-o-w-l-y (for me at least) coming on, thought I'd try Mio.  Good, plus the fruit punch is red (always a good thing), reminds me of Hawaiian Punch and what we called back when I was a kid at summer campe, bug juice (yum yum).  I'm happily sitting here after playing outside toda in the hot sun, I'm all sweaty but have my shoes off and a large glass of this Mio slowly being sipped away.  Happiness is.....  I found the strawberry-watermelon too sweet as most artificial strawberry-flavored things are (wish they'd make just a watermelon).  And I'm hitting the stores tomorrow to try to find the purple one and that green one (don't know what flavor that could be).  Wish Mio would make an ice tea with lemon flavor, maybe even an iced coffee flavor because these little bottles are easy to carry around, and I don't make a whole quart of stuff since everyone else woul drink it, with the little bottles I can do a glass as I go.",4,1

"I had high hopes for this product. I love chocolate milk, and I use stevia to replace sugar whenever I can. Unfortunately, this stuff was just gross. I even tried it a second time hoping that I would like it better, but it was still too gross to drink.",1,0
"This product is amazing. I initially bought the smallest canister to see how I would like it and I was immediately hooked! Not only does it give you gradual energy that is sustained throughout the day but it detoxifies your body. I remain very regular on it and see vast changes in my mood and energy level. I am unsure if it's helped my hair, skin and nails but they seem to be looking great so I would tend to think the juice is the cause.  It doesn't taste the best but can be masked with any type of juice. My boss makes an entire meal out of it but in the mornings I don't have time to chop up and blend fruits so I just mix it in some juice, chug and I'm on my way.<br /><br />This green powder is a must have!!",5,1
First of all I happen to think this is delicious. It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.,5,1
These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!

"PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)",5,1

"Seeds are a staple in my household, I always have flax for baking, hemp seeds for snacking, and chia for added protein, iron, calcium, and omega-3s in my daily morning smoothies. I know you can add chia seeds to salads, but I don't personally prefer the taste. They don't really have any taste, so they aren't bad, just not something I would personally eat a spoonful of. Chia seeds are an important to my daily routine because they have a decent amount of iron and don't hurt my stomach. I'm very sensitive to iron supplements, and don't eat meat, Chia seeds is something my doctor recommended I try to add to my diet, and he and I are both glad I did. Navitas Naturals makes excellent products, and I have purchased many of their brand items. In my freezer right now is their raw maca powder, cacao nibs, flax seeds, mulberries, acai powder, wheatgrass, and goji berries. I am always impressed with the freshness and quality. I have not noticed any processing remnants in their products, and they always arrive fresh from Amazon, who seems to have a much better turnaround time than my local Whole Foods. And the price is unbeatable. My favorite smoothie is 1 cup of almond milk, 1 scoop of wheat grass or Amazing Grass, a huge spoon of whatever nut butter is in freshly made, 1 teaspoon chia seeds, 1 tablespoon hemp seeds or hemp protein powder, 1 tablespoon cacao nibs, two huge handfuls of spinach, a banana, and ice. This tides me over from 6 am until I eat lunch around 1. (The Chia contribute a lot, since they gel up when in contact with liquid, they leave you feeling fuller for longer) I'd prefer to give 4.5 stars for nutritional benefits and ease of incorporation, but like I said, the taste is lacking. It is not nutty, despite their claims. It's really a ""non-flavor"" and wish they didn't lead you to believe most people would want to just snack on these as they are.",5,1

"I'm a big fan of both green and mint teas, so moroccan mint (a blend of mint and green) is a natural favorite of mine.<br /><br />I've tried moroccan mint from other places, and have not been impressed. The moroccan mint from teavana was just plain gross. This though, I can say is the best tea I've ever had.<br /><br />A great price too. Something like a dollar per ounce.

"I discovered the Sokenbicha line of Japanese teas at my local Fresh and Easy store. They're excellent, but rather expensive. The latest one I've tried is a bold Barley Tea Blend. Man, this stuff is really good and unlike any other tea I've ever had. I'm at a loss to describe the flavor. It's fairly strong for a tea and has a wonderful aftertaste. It must be the barley. The green tea or pu'er tea might help too. In any case, it's a really refreshing tea served ice cold. It's unsweetened and has zero calories. My oh my!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",5,1
"I freakin' LOVE peanut butter. Peanut butter is a good quick snack, but has quite a few calories. This stuff tastes really close, and you can adjust the amount of water to create the consistency you like.  My only problem is the cost. This jar doesn't make an equivalent jar full of the final product.  To demonstrate, this jar makes enough for about 4 or 5 peanut butter sandwiches.  Again, I am a peanut butter lover, and this tastes great.  My only problem is the cost.  P.S. I've lost 130 pounds over the last 18 months, so to me the cost is worth it.  Just purchase it knowing these facts.",4,1
"My dog loves stella and chewy's raw freeze-dried dog food.<br />These Raw Bites from Instinct are pretty similar (grain-free, raw, freeze-dried), except the size is smaller to act as ""Treat-sized"" bites.<br /><br />Treat-sized is great b/c these little disks can fit into a puzzle toy. Regular Stella & Chewy's are a bit too large for most toys. Secondly, the Raw Bites are a touch harder, therefore less flaky and crumbly than Stella & Chewys. This results in less mess!<br /><br />Overall a great treat and product, just a little pricey (as with all raw, grain-free freeze-dried dog food).",4,1
"Do not waste your money on this. I waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. Made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee, dropped in two tablets. Nothing. I dropped in two more.

"I've tried many pancake mixes in my time, but this is the only one i come back to. I order it by the case from Hogdson Mills' catalog.

"This is one of the few chicken cat foods that don't contain some kind of fish and my cat loves it.  One of my 3 has allergies to fish so I have had somewhat of a challenge finding food without any type of fish protein.  She can also have lamb, which does help as far as alternating and giving her variety.  This one is just wonderful in that it doesn't contain any synthetic vitamins.  A great approach and well received in my home.  One of my other cats has a longer allergy list and is currently on rabbit, which is even harder to find.  She is on the top 3 brands that offer rabbit, including this one.  She loves it, so I thought I would try the chicken flavor for my little fish-less one and it turned out to be a rewarding venture.  I find the price competitive with this type of food and will keep it in their rotations.  It is drier than other brands, but I just cut it up and add about a tablespoon of water on top.  They lick it off like gravy.  Good deal.",5,1

"If you are looking for a cuppa with a bit of spice in it this is good.  I've had several different flavors of this brand and think this one is right up at the top of my list but anything pumpkin is at this point.  It works out nicely when you can't get out to the coffee shop to get a fresh cuppa pumpkin spice and it's great on those rainy cool evenings when you just need something warm and the taste of the Autumn Season.  I did however find that I needed to use a bit more than called for so it wouldn't be weak.  I think I used an extra teaspoon.<br /><br />Another way to really enjoy this is to put two teaspoons into a cup of hot cocoa.  Yumm!  I think this is my favorite way of drinking this so far.  I also use a bit of fresh creamer just for more body.  Overall, I like it!  An inexpensive product with good flavor and ease of use for those lazy cold days to come.",4,1
"My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.",5,1

"These bars are wonderful!  Full of nuts and the box says just 6 grams of sugar, much lower than others I have tried.  The protein really fills me up and keeps me sated for 2+ hours. I think they taste like Cracker Jack without the popcorn, very light and crunchy.<br /><br />Other nut bars I have tried are chewy and the nuts tend to lose their snap sitting in nougat-style binding; these are lightly sweet and brittle.  I break up the bar before I open the open the pouch and pop in the clusters while I work to keep me away from the donuts in the break room.<br /><br />The price is fantastic: the amazon.com 6 pack breaks down to 57 cents a bar, which is WAY less expensive than other nut bars of this quality.  I used to eat KIND bars, but they are over $1 a bar and more sugar.<br /><br />There are only 8 ingredients and I can pronounce and recognize them all; there is corn syrup in these, but it is not High Fructose Corn Syrup (which is modified and not very good for you).  I eat about 3-4 of these a week.<br /><br />Another tip: I am 6 months pregnant and find these a perfect thing to keep in my purse for when I need a nosh to keep me from getting light-headed, the protein and low sugar keeps me buoyant and doesn't send me crashing.  One of these, a string cheese and a piece of fresh fruit is a filling and easy mid-day meal when I am pressed for time.",5,1
"I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!",5,1
I have two dogs. One of them is a picky eater and totally unmotivated by food (much to the annoyance of dog trainers who have tried to use treats as a training tool with her). I have purchased other treats and found that I had to give them all to my second dog (who is in danger of getting fat!).  Not Newman's Own Cheese Treats! My picky eater loves them and eagerly competes with my other dog for her share. Excellent product.,5,1
I was disappointed at this item when it arrived. It's really a very small gift basket and not worth $40.00 (maybe $25.00). I expected more - I'd recommend avoiding this.,2,0
"Needless to say my cat is very fussy. She has been eating fancy feast for as long as she's lived with me and will only eat the ""sliced"" food. It's nice to have the 3 flavors she likes. I feed her the more expensive brands but she always comes back to this product.",5,1
"I was very disappointed with the order.  It didn't have the flavors advertised in the picture.  They substituted  flavors I didn't want or like and left out the ones I was really wanting.  They also just threw them in the box,bad packaging.  I felt they were getting rid of excess flavors they weren't selling or had plenty of and left out the special ones in the photo.  I will never order K cups here again.  I feel I have wasted my money.  If  had wanted gingerbread..I would have ordered it..now I am stuck with flavors I really don't like.",1,0
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",1,0
"If you struggled for years using store bought green split peas and have never been satisfied with your soup, struggle no more.  For years I tried different recipes and was never satisfied with the end result because of the inferior product I was using.

There is no dissapointment here. This farming family knows how to delivery fresh!",5,1

"I just LOVE this coffee!  It's just so light, not heavy and ""burned"" like a lot of morning coffees, but it has all the caffeine that you're accustomed to for morning.  I have always loved Caribou's coffees WAY over Starbuck's (Starbuck's is AWESOME for growing roses, however), and this one is just perfect for us.  It's not overdone, just a smooth, rich blend of some of the most awesome beans available.  If you put your nose close enough to your Keurig, this one is a delight to smell after you pull down the handle and it pierces the top. Ahhhhh!  SO LOVE this stuff, highly highly recommend!",5,1
"My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent. I have noticed though that if opened (with lid on) for more than 1 week, it starts to become less crunchy and more on the chewy side.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 35, Serving Size 18 pieces, Servings per container 6, Sodium 50mg<br />% Daily Value for infants 0-1:<br />Protein 0%, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 10%, Vitamin E 20%, Zinc 15%",5,1
"Essentia's slogan is ""Try it for the taste. Buy it for the benefits"" is very apt.  It has a wonderful, refreshing taste and I admit to being a lifetime, lifelong lover and advocate of drinking water.  It is very cool, soothing and refreshing under any and all conditions.  It's just good water.<br /><br />Essentia is somewhat costly in stores, but when I had a chance to order this from Amazon, I jumped at the chance!  It is ""Aqua Vita,"" water of life.  I love it!",5,1
"I know some have given these a bad review for their taste.  I really like the taste - and most would consider me a picky eater.  I think they taste similar to muncho's without as much salt.  When you need a salty snack, this is a great one to try.",5,1
These were my kids favorite.  No orange mess and a light crunchy texture.,5,1
"As someone who has taken up backpacking this summer, I have dived head-first into recipies beyond that of trail mixes.  Alot has been written about the taste of powdered eggs vs. that of regular eggs, all I can say is that there is a definite difference-but just remember-when you're in the middle of nowhere-this product will take care of your craving for eggs.  The product comes in a coffee-can sized tin that probabily take an individual like myself about a whole season of weekly camping to go through.  This product would be great for those trips with a group of people to cook for.  I've also tried the product in baked recipies with a fair amount of success",4,1

Very moist, tasty.  I plan to buy the other varieties of this brand (choclate chip, etc.) because of this positive experience.<br /><br />* highly recommended *",5,1

"I grew up on this British baby biscuit and was SO happy to find that Amazon sells it (my Mum was sending it to me by post!).  As a child and even now as an adult, I loved/love dipping it in milk (only briefly, so it doesn't dissolve).  It's only lightly sweet so it's perfect for young kids instead of snacks that are loaded with corn syrup.  It's safe for a baby who is teething because it dissolves rather quickly on contact with liquid (saliva) though, for safety, you should still always be close by when the baby is eating it.  Only snag: have a vacuum ready to suck up the crumbs after eating!",5,1

Every vacation, I stock up and buy like 10 of these from a local convenience store in Asbury Park! Please make them available so I can stock up more than once a vacation! I still have two left in my fridge, waiting patiently for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, purchased when I went on vacation in early June!<br /><br />This is by far my favorite Arizona product... Its light, yet flavorful. unbelievably thirst quenching, and made with real sugar. So much better than soda...",5,1
"I have been purchasing pill pockets for about 6 months now due to my 7 yr old Beagle needing her medicine twice a day.  She is excited to eat them everyday and doesn't have a clue her medicine is in them....or doesn't care because of the yummy taste.  The price was excellent compared to the $9 - $12 for one packet in most pet stores.  More suprisingly was the customer service I received.  After sending an email requesting money back for my expedited shipping costs as I did not think I received my order in time, I quickly got a response.  A representative from the company explained exactly how expedited shipping actually worked (I wish Amazon was this detailed) and that they were in fact within the time limit as promised.  I received several emails back that not only answered all my questions, but also educated me on the whole shipping process.  I appreciated the personalized service I received, and can't wait to buy from them again!",5,1

"Let me start by saying that I generally don't find this type of chocolate<br />( flavor ) appealing; not even a bit interesting.<br />However, I really liked this chocolate. I was a bit scared ( yes scared ) because it really sounded nasty to be honest with you, but I promised myself that I would try at least one new thing a month.

"Tortilla chip in existence. If you like popcorn and tortilla chips but are interested in eating healthy,this chip gives you all three! The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due.

I had strange sores on my penis and had not been bad, went to the Doc, he said it was either staph or herpes, 3 months later I bought the trap and found Bedbugs, looked up up the bites on google and it was a perfect match! I guess you know how happy I am. I have not been bite since . I cant imagine how many people have been miss informed about what they have ? This product is a must have, one in every room!",5,1
When the boxes arrived the top of each was a little squished but it did not affect the product at all. I would def. order again.,5,1
"Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect ""unwinding"" drink before bedtime. Not ""spicy"" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.",5,1
"Always have been fond of Oh Henry bars, but they can be hard to find at times in the store. While you have to be careful when ordering a 36 pack that you ration them out appropriately, this worked out to be a good deal since there was a special going on at the time I ordered.  They arrived fresh and in great condition.<br /><br />Love the Oh Henry's!",5,1

I eat it for breakfast with cinnamon and almonds, or I eat it for dinner or lunch with a pilaf recipe.  Ordering from Amazon.com is much cheaper than I have found it in any grocery stores.  Nice value.",5,1
"Basmati rice has to be one of the most delicate forms of this grain on the face of the earth, and Trader Joe's medley of rice and spices has for at least two years served as our family's standard replacement for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZY8XE"">Near East Original  Rice Pilaf</a>, which we once upon a time adored.<br /><br />Even at Amazon, this package comes to 27 cents an ounce --- although at the local Trader Joe's, the one-pound bag of this stuff goes for a mere $2. It lasts for many many meals, and compares very favorably, therefore, with Near East's $2.65 to $2.95 for a six ounce boxes that serve, at most, six people.<br /><br />I'll admit that the Near East brand does taste divine, as it includes pine nuts and other such not featured in this Basmati rice medley. But the far superior cost of Trader Joe's provides a win win.<br /><br />Having said that, I must agree with the previous reviewer, who comments upon the excessive cost of this item at Amazon. It's twice as much as the cost from the store.<br /><br />Best bet, find a Trader Joe's, or telegraph a relative who lives near one, to ship you a big carton of the stuff once every six months or so.",5,1
"Excellent on salads, veggies, in soups, just about anything.  Wonderfull compliment to your cooking.

Delicious.",5,1
"I just made my first pitcher of this sugar-free mix and was very disappointed, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  I suppose the tea part of this mix is fine, but to me, it is overwhelmed by the cloying sweetness of the Splenda artificial sweetener. There is a faint lemon taste too, but not enough tartness to compensate for all the sweetness.  So, if you love VERY sweet iced tea and want to avoid the calories of sugar, then you'll probably like this tea mix. The taste of Splenda (Sucralose) is better than that of NutraSweet (aspartame), but avoiding both of them is probably healthier. So, I think I'll now try the Twinings English Classic Cold-brewed Tea <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028GWGYW"">Twinings English Classic Cold Brewed Tea, 20-Count Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and just add my own lemon and a dash of sugar.",2,0
"This Scotch was a mystery to me; I always thought that Johnnie Walker only came in colors. Turns out, they have this little quiet Scotch called Swing.<br /><br />Swing is a soft, delicate, smooth Scotch. There is a lot of honey flavor along with an incredible smoothness. This Scotch is very easy to drink. There is no smoky flavor at all.<br /><br />So where does it fit in the color scheme of things, someplace close to Gold. The price point is slightly more expensive than Gold. Where Red, Black, Double Black, and Green make a wonderful smoky progression, culminating with Blue, Swing stands almost alone. Its cousin is Gold, but Swing is much more refined and maybe a little bit sweeter.<br /><br />I love this Scotch, and I am a died in the wool smoke fan - Green is one of my favorite every day drinking Scotch. I really dislike Gold, it is too thick and the edges are too sharp and unfinished. Swing hits a very happy medium with those edges smoothed off. There are no really sharp flavors in this Scotch, just a lovely sweet honey flavor.<br /><br />From the Johnnie Walker website, Swing was supposed to be made for sailing ships, to take to the new worlds and sell. The shape of the bottle was supposed to keep it upright in a ship. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the bottle. The maritime story is nice, but I much prefer Johnnie Walker's square bottle. The sad thing, this looks like a Crown Royal or Pinch bottle, and frankly was the reason I'd never bought it before. Don't judge a book by its cover; the contents are far better than Crown Royal or Pinch.<br /><br />If you like smooth Scotch, this is a winner.<br /><br />The picture for this product makes the bottle look like it has hideous black lines on it. The bottle is really beautiful - clear glass with the amber Scotch inside. There are no black vercrose veins on the bottle.",5,1
"You can try every tea ever made, every flavor ever concocted, and you'll still swear that this is your absolute favorite tea - once you try it.

This one is hard to find, so we're especially thankful that we found it on Amazon!",5,1

Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.",5,1
"Although the product description made this tea sound pretty wonderful, I was still skeptical, having been a serious tea drinker now for 15 years.  I'm even more skeptical of the quality of bagged teas, since many ""pyramid"" teabags still have tea leaf fannings or even dust in them, just like the old school ""flat"" tea bags.  This tea not only brews up into a hefty serving of BOP, but the taste is fresh and clean, yet complex enough to be considered a decent spring flush Darjeeling.  I was thrilled, because it can be difficult to find a good spring flush that is affordable and organic as well!  And, while I generally prefer loose tea to bagged, I can use this at work when I'm pressed for time and still enjoy what I'm drinking.  It would be great if the bags weren't stuffed into very small (albeit freshness-preserving) packages which, on my clumsier days, is hard to open without feeling like I'm smashing the leaves.  The teabag strings could be a bit longer as well.  But these are very small complaints, and they will not stop me from ordering again.  If the packaging helps to keep this tea as affordable as it is, it's a small inconvenience to put up with.<br /><br /> I am also going to try this brand's other Darjeelings--check them out!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQ8"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Autumn Flush, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OPY"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Monsoon Flush,  20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQI"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Green, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OP4"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Sample Pack, 5-Count Teabags (Pack of 24)</a>",5,1

"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness?

This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.",4,1
So I started a Gluten-free diet with my husband a few weeks ago. It has definitely helped in trimming our waist-lines as well as in picking up our energy levels. Not so much in finding tasty or non-expensive food. I was looking for a healthy yet flavorful snack that won't break the budget and I decided to try this Kind bar stuff. Boy was I blown away by its freshness and rich flavors. I started with the coconut almond. So yummy and filling. A perfect way to grab a quick bite when you're on the go and without sacrificing health or flavor. Highly recommended!,5,1
"Somebody brought this tea to work and left it in the cabinet, presumably because they didn't like it.  I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but if you like a sour citrus flavor, you will love this tea.  The fragrance reminds me of lime Sweet-Tarts with an undertone of cedar.  The flavor is very tart, but adding sugar makes it far less so.  It is a complex tea that might just end up being your favorite.",5,1
"My beagle-daschund Pixel needed a lot of re-training when I got her, as her previous ""owner"" had neglected her for several months. The Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats were perfect for use in training, because they're small, low-calorie, and healthy, so I didn't feel like I was over-feeding her by using them throughout the day.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pixel had a very sensitive stomach when I first got her, these treats never made her sick (her previous ""owner"" had not fed her regularly, she was underweight, and the food she had gotten was of poor quality, so for several weeks after I got her, most foods made her sick).<br /><br />I still use these treats, as they're made from good, simple ingredients, they're free of wheat/corn/soy, and they're low-calorie. Plus, Pixel loves them!<br /><br />A tip for using these tiny treats: I fill a plastic medicine bottle with these treats (they're small, and about 15 will fit in the container), and keep it in my jacket pocket to use while on walks.<br /><br />I also filled a medicine bottle with these and I keep it in the car, which has been useful in two ways. First, it's nice to have a treat for Pixel when she goes in the car. Second, while driving I have encountered my neighbor's escaped dog twice in the past few months, and having treats with me makes it much easier to catch her and return her to her home!",5,1

"My wife likes to start her day with a taste of chocolate, so when Amazon's Subscribe & Save program began offering Chocolate Cheerios at a competitive price we placed an order. The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.<br /><br />Of course, my wife would eat Chocolate Cheerios with or without the toy. She eats the cereal with 2% milk and a cup of black coffee because, really, you don't need cream or sugar when you're eating a bowl of chocolate cereal.<br /><br />Getting to the basics: the cereal was tightly packaged with no damage; the expiration date extends at least 12 months out, so there's no mad dash to consume six boxes at once; and the price is competitive with the supermarkets we regularly patronize. The added convenience of the cereal arriving at our doorstep rather than hauling it home in shopping bags is a bonus.<br /><br />Personally, I don't touch the stuff. I'm more of a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LV6LQS"">Post Raisin Bran Cereal</a> kind of guy. And, yes, of course, we buy that through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program as well.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars",5,1
Last time I checked a package of these in the market they were made in CHINA.,1,0
"I love Splenda! I use it every morning in my coffee. I have diabetes so I definitely cannot use regular plain old delicious sugar. However, Splenda is approved by my doctors because it does not raise my glucose levels.<br /><br />Using Splenda with added B vitamins gives me that little extra boost of nutrients while still using the same product I've been using. B1, B5, and B6 are added to this product to help support a healthy immune system as well as maintain healthy hair and skin. Splenda has added 20% of the daily value of the B vitamins to their sweetener.<br /><br />For me there was no difference in flavor from the original sweetener and I'm very pleased with this product. I usually use the fluffier Splenda so it was a little more difficult for me to gauge the same amount between the two products. I did not notice a different smell but I've never really been that close.<br /><br />I do like knowing that I'm gaining healthy nutrients while still being able to enjoy food and drinks without all the extra sugar. However, it is a little bit more expensive than the regular sweetener. Which is normal because vitamins themselves are pretty expensive. I personally, think it's worth it.<br /><br />I think the important thing to keep in mind is that adding vitamins to your regime is healthy it's not a replacement for not eating properly. It's a supplement.",5,1
"This tea is hard to find so I bought 6 boxes. When you open the packet, the bag smells exactly like fresh peaches. The taste is not masked by other flavors such as cinnamon. It makes wonderful iced tea.",5,1
I love this popcorn! It makes it so easy to cook the best popcorn every.  I don't think I can ever go back to buying separate stuff and putting it together myself.,5,1
"This is probably the best granola I have ever had. It only has 6 grams of sugar, where most granola cereals have 15 grams or more. The taste is incredible; a well rounded cinnamon flavor and the granola itself is pretty uniform in texture which I like. No huge clumps. The flax seeds are also a nice touch and lend good flavor to the mix. I also like the packaging. Its compact and easy to both open and seal back up. I was about to give up on store bought granola but this changed my mind. Love it.",5,1
"My 14 month old loves this stuff--it's a little chunkier than some of their other products, but it's a great introduction to solids!",5,1
"I ordered Valerian Root tea. The price was a great deal, and shipment was really fast! I would recommend this seller to anyone, and I would definitely do business with them again.",5,1
"Most celery salt is salt with some celery in it. However, this product is much better -- it is celery with some salt in it. The celery flavor is very strong, has a nice peppery flavor, and smells good, too. The amount of salt is possibly not quite enough, but that's easily remedied by just adding regular salt to your food. I tried this in a ramen noodle soup (which is already quite salty) and it really tasted quite good. If you like celery salt I do recommend this product over the store brands. It has a much nicer flavor and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Also, my order didn't come in a plastic bag like the photo shows; it came in a little plastic spice jar with a shaker top. I have ordered other bulk items from Barry Farms and they have just been in plastic bags, so this was a nice surprise.",5,1
"My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.",5,1
I was very disappointed when I received this shipment as many of the gel packs were busted and leaking.  This defeated the purpose of buying them online in bulk to pay less per packet.  I will just go back to buying them at Academy.,2,0
"Whole vanilla beans come in three ""flavors"":  Mexican, Tahitian, and Bourbon-Madagascar.  Because Mexican beans are reputed to have the boldest, best vanilla flavor, I had to try some in my favorite ""speckled vanilla"" ice cream recipe.  Usually I make this recipe with the more common Bourbon-Madagascar beans.<br /><br />The Mexican  beans did not disappoint:  they produced an especially delicious, full-flavored vanilla ice cream.  In the future, Mexican vanilla beans will always be my first choice for making plain vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />The Mexican vanilla beans that I purchased from Arizona Vanilla were plump, moist, and beautiful.  Although they were a little more expensive than Bourbon-Madagascar beans, they were still far less expensive than the whole vanilla beans sold in spice jars in grocery stores.  The Mexican beans were a little shorter and smaller than the Bourbon-Madagascar beans that I purchased from a different seller, but this is probably a characteristic of the different plant types.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great book of ice cream recipes, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060187654"">The Best Ice Cream Maker Cookbook Ever</a>, which includes the ""speckled vanilla"" recipe.

If you prefer a less earthy matcha and the health benefits of a white tea this is the way to go! I want to address that Red Leaf Tea has an excellent QUALITY tea provided to you! Customer service is excellent as well! I was very pleased with my purchase of this white matcha from Red Leaf Tea.,5,1
"I purchased several flavors and enjoy them all. This is a nice, warm snack you will enjoy.",5,1
This is nearly the only treat that does not make my 8 month puppy sick.  Although a good value when purchased on Amazon they are still a bit expensive.  Since I don't brush my dog's teeth they are worth the money.,5,1
"When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.",4,1
These are much better than I expected. They have quite a bit of flavor and go great with a cup of coffee in the mid morning when there is a craving for something sweet but not indulging in something like a donut or other high calorie snack. I like these and the the strawberry ones are good too. Don't expect to get full on eating a packet of these. They just fill in between meals.,5,1
"This mix creates yummy scones and short bread.  We have used it to make plain scones with a little sugar on top, flattened it out and usd it for strawberry shortcake and also made scones with fresh blueberries.  All versions turned out great.  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs so it is great for us to find a mix that you add your own version of both.  I was able to substitute soy milk and margarine for the regular versions of each and the results were great.",5,1
"These tomatoes are BY FAR better than any ""real"" San Marzano tomatoes I've ever had (I've had brands shipped to me from Arthur Ave, which were straight from Italy). They are so sweet, and you can eat them right out of the can!",5,1
"This is an excellent cake that tastes as good as any other chocolate cake I have ever had. I made cupcakes to freeze and remove individually as needed. They were moist, but not soggy the day after. They also froze very well. The directions are slightly involved. Not difficult at all but it does take a bit longer to mix up than the typical cake mix. The results are definitely worth the extra time though. Tastes great with peanut butter frosting!<br /><br />Many gluten free mixes contain soy; this one doesn't. Nor does it contain any of the other 8 common allergens. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is the cost. Limiting the servings per person helps compensate for the cost of this product.",5,1
I love lemon pepper--I was amazed with this one--large grain and fresh.  Very large jar that delighted me because I use this in nearly everything.  Good tight jar to keep it fresh.  Very inexpensive.  Good buy for home cooks.,5,1

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.",1,0
"This is terrible to say, but the one thing I hate about all these healthier ""whole foods"" is that they taste so different than the refined products that I am used to. White bread, white rice, etc. These have a good amount of fiber, and I didn't notice any difference in taste when eating them with Vietnamese food (I made Bo Xa Lui Nuong the first time). Get some!",5,1

"Aaah, nothing like good black tea!  Black tea, in addition to having a very pleasant flavor has many health properties.  It regulates your blood sugar; it is cardio-healthy; it inhibits cancer; it reverses clogging of the arteries; it has anti-oxidants; it is an anti-inflammatory and virus buster and it just plain tastes good.  The myriad of varieties of English teas are derived from black tea.  If you want good, affordable black tea, then you want this tea.",5,1
"It's very good, not as strong of coconut flavor and taste as I would like but it will do. I prefer it on toast but it tastes good on popcorn too.",4,1

She has a beautiful coat , shining eyes and is full of energy! Highly reccomended.",5,1
My dog seems to like these just fine.  I only give him Holistic Select products due to his sensitive gastrointestinal system.,4,1

"Some reviews will tell you this is the best spice others will say this is fake tasting. To me and my bacon-loving-wife it's a fair substitute. If you use this ""salt"" you will get a bacon flavor and you will get a little salt. This product will give you a bacon flavor. The dishes I have used it most in is my baked potato soup. The soup turns orange, but I do get a bacon flavor without having to add bacon. This can be a good substitute when bacon is not around. It will not take the place of bacon in all cooking. The part of the bacon that adds the most flavor is the fat. This can not be mimicked. Also, one of the things bacon adds is texture.<br /><br />As I have said: good substitute. It's also a good novelty item or something for the in-laws to talk about during supper.",4,1

"I discovered True Lemon in the packets and started carrying it around and keeping it at work to liven up the gallons of water I normally consume.  I went to re-order online and saw shakers!  What?  Why would I want a water flavor in a shaker form?  Answer is simple: this stuff is fantastic on food.  Sprinkle it on chicken and seafood.  Veggies pop with a little True Lemon.  Give up the salt, pour on the True Lemon.",5,1
"You won't notice that it's Vegan.  It tastes good, and it's reasonably good for you.  We find that just keeping these in the freezer, then cutting the top of an individual package open and zapping it in the microwave for 25 seconds is the best way to handle storage and preparation.  Wash it down with a hot drink such as coffee or chai tea, and it's a pretty satisfying breakfast on the go.  My wife packs a two-pack of frozen veggie sausage and a small paper plate along with my lunch.  After I arrive at work, I supplement the coffee and cookie I had along the way with the sausage. (Morning Star Farms soy sausage tastes pretty much like traditional sausage to me, but it's less greasy, and can be zapped for 1 minute, 25 seconds on a paper plate by way of prep.)  I usually have old-fashioned V-8 or one of the veggie/fruit fusion versions as well.  Sometimes we switch it up and go with some of the better tasting turkey sausages -- surprisingly, Jimmy Dean has them.  My wife sticks to the cookie (there are lots of different flavors) and chai tea, then has the veggie sausage as a mid-morning snack with brown mustard.  She doesn't have the V-8 until mid-afternoon, after soup for lunch.  (My lunch is usually a 6-in. Subway or something relatively substantial.)<br /><br />I've lost weight slowly, which in my case is a good thing. Remember, these are 300 calorie cookies, so plan accordingly. I used to have a home-made breakfast sandwich every morning, and now do the sandwich only on occasion. I'm getting older, and don't need quite as many calories as I used to. In case anyone is curious, the breakfast sandwich consisted of two slices of whole grain bread, a slice of thin, pre-sliced ham (prefer Dap), and an Eggbeater omelet my wife makes. You spray olive oil to coat the insides of a microwaveable 2 C. (you can use a 4 C if you want the eggs spread out more) measuring cup, add about 300 ml. of Eggbeaters (I like their Southwestern-style), a T. or 2 T. of chunky salsa (we like Pace), and a couple of large pinches of your favorite pre-grated cheese (we like Sargento's light 3 cheese or ""Mexican"" cheese.) Cover and zap for about 4 minutes, or until fluffy and done.  Slap it between the bread with the ham, and away you go. Hungry guys can add one or two whole eggs to the whole thing, as it just takes longer to zap, say 6 to 6.30 minutes.",5,1

Anyway, this is what I eat when I can't think of anything else I'd rather eat.<br /><br />Oh, and I doctor mine a bit. Try adding some garlic powder, salt, and pepper into the water. Most of the spice boils out and gets dumped with the water, but it makes a big difference, taste-wise.",5,1
"Overall, I found this a pretty tasty, crunchy granola cluster snack. The clusters seem to precipitate toward the bottom, but c'est la vie. The taste was good as was the texture. Good for snacking or as topping or cereal (though there'd only be enough for a couple bowls, like 2-3?). Though, I felt like it maybe needed something extra like some dried tropical fruit mixed in or something? Maybe I'll have to try making my own sometime... But, as it was, I liked it.

"My cat just love them, chomping down the kibbles. He has started to gain weight & muscle back, and I am very happy with the results. I also add 1/4 cup of NON salted chicken soup after the food.

The phosphorous level is 0.65% dry matter, considered to be on the low but acceptable. The protein(30%) quality is high, grain free and acceptable fat(18%) level. Most other non-prescription dry kibbles phosphorous range from 0.60% to 2%. Only prescription food can be lower than 0.5%. Phosphorous is important to health, but must be on lower range for pets with that are phosphorous sensitive.<br /><br />Price of food is on par with other grain free, non rendered meats pet food.

Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it!

So far I have tried the chocolate-raspberry, cranberry-citris, and blueberry-brown sugar. Fig is next. Chocolate is my favourite, it is real cocoa flavor. I will say this... you can't have just two cookies! Tasty with lower calories than most packaged cookies. I came on Amazon hoping to find a well-priced package of 4, but the pricing is outrageous, one can find them much less expensive on sale at the supermarket if you can even find them. The chocolate-raspberry goes fast and least available. You won't go wrong with the other flavors though.",5,1

Generally, with as much crap as I put in it (think half and half, flavored creamer, truvia and flavored syrup), I can no longer taste the coffee. *DUH* I bet you are saying, ""well clearly she doesn't like the taste of coffee"" but really I do! So I am usually left thinking ""why did I put so much crap in my coffee??"" Well, problem solved with this Dark Magic. The [great] coffee flavor comes through loud and clear, even with all my additions. I can only imagine that if I DIDN'T put all this crap in it I might singe my nose hairs because boy is it strong! You people who drink it without diluting it, a lot, are my heroes.",5,1
"I used to get this at Costco, but there isn't a Costco where I live now.  I bought some other jerky at the grocery store once when I was craving it and was very disappointed, so I was thrilled to find this online alternative.  This is the best jerky ever.  You can't go wrong with Original Pacific Gold Beef Jerky!",5,1
"I liked having a cold can of illy issimo Coffee Drink handy for one of those late-night deadlines; it's quick, it's tasty, it requires no preparation, and it pries my eyes open for me. I'm a real baby about sweet, milky coffee, but this is just fine. It reminds me of the canned coffee I find in Europe or in Vietnamese groceries - so cosmopolitan! This isn't as fatty or over-sweet as some of the popular American cold coffee drinks, and I like the lighter taste. It's worth keeping around.",4,1
I use Dreamfields pasta as a means to control my blood sugar.  It is and excellent product and tastes as good as the real pasta but without the digestible carbs that real pasta has.  If you have diabetes this is a good product to use in lieu of real pasta.,5,1
These cookies are one of my favorites.  They are very light and are excellent with milk or coffee.  I can't wait for them to go on sale again so I can stock up!!,5,1
Great food.  Healthy.  My two cats really eat this stuff up like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />My one cat started chewing the bag to get to it. It's not like my cats don't get feed<br />they do and are never starving. Both my cats are 17-19 lbs.so you know they eat! lol<br /><br />I would reccomend this food for your cat. Excellent Natural Indgedients.<br /><br />Worth the price.,5,1
These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!,5,1
"Finally I received this sauce. I had to order it 3 times, until I now finally got the parcel (UPS has stolen the first 2 shipments!) I was reluctant to even try for a third time, because I was not sure if amazon would still believe me if also the third order wouldn't arrive. So I had it shipped to Hubby's office address.<br /><br />And here I am, happy that I did it, because this sauce is really a delicate accompaniment to any pasta, and I would have missed out if I had given up!<br /><br />I had previously tried the Basil sauce and the Puttanesca sauce of this brand, and this variety is also really good. No processed ingredients, it is just like homemade, but faster. I am usually cooking my sauces from scratch, but I have these jars as a back up if I am really tired or sick or just too lazy. Contains only natural ingredients, not processed crap that the corporations are dumping into their supermarket brands.<br /><br />A bit pricey, yes, but you have to pay for the quality and the convenience. One malus point I would give, though: this variety is only available in the smaller jars. So for a dinner with 500 g pasta I would need 1.5 jars, that means I will have half a jar open in the fridge. I would prefer a bigger size jar, just like the other varieties have. That is the only complaint I have. (The fact that UPS is employing a thief is not their fault, I am aware!)",4,1
"I used to drive to the local coffee shop for hazelnut coffee or iced hazelnut coffee EVERY DAY! I received a Keurig for a gift, and now, no more added time to my daily commute. It's just delicious hot or iced.",5,1
"On behalf of all Orgain-addicts such as myself, thank you!  I was hoping that you would make this eligible for your subscribe and save program!  Orgain is part of my diet twice a day and I'm always running out.  It is also sometimes VERY hard to find.<br /><br />Now all we need you to do is add a once/week or once/2weeks option, keep it in stock and do the same for Chocolate Fudge.<br /><br />Merry Christmas to us, huh?  THANKS!!",5,1
"I went to see my son in Germany in 1986.  Couldn't decide whether to pack a can of Cafe Vienna, or take a chance I'd find it there.  Took a chance, and lo and behold, my son had a can for me in his cupboard!<br /><br />My day just isn't complete without starting the day with my Cafe Vienna.",5,1
Timothy's decafe suits me since I can only drink decafe coffee.  I do wish there were more decafe k-cups to choose.<br />It seems Timothy's is the only one I came across.,4,1
This stuff is wonderful. I even talked to my pharmacy about it and they thought it was full of vitamins and fine to drink. I talked to my doctor about it and told her how it made me feel better. She said that she couldn't recommend it-since she is my doctor but she said it was full of vitamins and thought it was fine to be taking it. I am nervous about taking things over the counter so I wanted to double check with the my pharmacist and doctor. I now drink a whole bottle  each morning when I get to work. It works great for me. I have more energy and feel more positive. I have a SI Joint pain at the moment due to an injury and this has help me through it. I like the grape flavor. In my opinion this is a terrific product-not like sugar that your crash shortly after.,5,1
You get alot for your money. When you have a minute to sit back and relax and enjoy a nice hot apple cider. Tastes pretty good. There's no reason hot apple cider should be a seasonal drink.  So with this six pack you get plenty to last you awhile. A pretty smart idea.,5,1
"We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.  My husband loves them so much that he doesn't even mind taking a ""kid snack"" to work.:-)<br />I've also found that if we get a box that's been damaged and broken up - the crumbs make an awesome pie crust!",5,1
"I have been having difficulty finding this blend at local stores. After trying many different flavors over the past 18 months, I find this the most enjoyable blend yet, followed closely by Kona blend. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this blend at an affordable price.",5,1
Product was exactly as stated and delivery was quick.  Would do business with again.,5,1
"This is THE BEST popcorn in a bag I've ever tasted, it comes close to being as good as my ""homemade"" air popped loaded with real butter without have the extra fat and calories.  The product is a bit pricey but I do wonder if its because they don't use GMO ingredients.",5,1
I currently deployed and coffee is life blood. The flavor is good without being over bearing. The price was reasonable.,4,1
"I have always loved fruit snacks, and I couldn't resist trying ones shaped like bunnies. These have a slightly softer texture than traditional fruit snacks, but they have very strong, realistic fruit flavors. The tropical ones are definitely my favorite.  I prefer these to most brands of traditional fruit snacks; however, the price is a little too high to buy them on a regular basis.",5,1
"This product has better grade materials used to create it than other ""general feed"" brands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60 - 75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality. You can use this as a filler mixed in with better brands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it. Diamond makes another version, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OH73FO"">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Cats, Active Cat Chicken and Rice Formula, 18 Pound Bag</a>  which is a premium type and much healthier. This mixes well 60/40 with it so i dont spend a fortune and they get very healthy meals. My cats like this just as much as the premium. I have a public wish list of other brands of healthy premium food here on amazon at good prices (around 1.50 - 2.00 lb)if anyone is interested. Hope this helps all your kitties!",4,1
I bought this before and it's good taste with more foam. Don't hesitate to buy. Hot cappuccino is the best other flavor good but this is the best.,5,1
"I love cooking a lot. And this mix just help me to make a DIY cake my self. And what is more, it does cheaper than market~",5,1
"Price is okay but shipping sucks don't count on Prime's 2 day delivery ordered July 31, rec.  I'm sure the product will be great and my dogs will love them.  Not saying I wouldn't purchase again from this seller, I just now know not to expect the receive it in two day statement.  Order early and wait.  They got 4 stars as I was rating the ITEM.",4,1
"I will say 4.5 for this tea, since I am leaning toward 4 but everyone else who drinks tea at my house loves it. For a plain black tea, it is reliably good, although I still prefer varieties like English Breakfast and Earl Grey.",4,1
I've been making Veggie Burgers from scratch for a few years and decided to try this product.  Very pleased with the taste and ease of making the burgers.,5,1
"High-end dark chocolate that is best eaten in moderation. When you eat chocolate of this nature, it is all about the quality and not the quantity. My only issue with this is the individual packaging. Due to the strength of the chocolate, the flavors tended to blend together due to the lack of quality wrapping needed to separate such strong flavors of chocolate. Besides that, this is a unique gift that will make someone feel very special!!!",4,1
"I love the thought that these baby foods are organic.  The shipping is quick, well packaged, and easy to open.  Baby likes ALL flavors so far of ANY type of Earth's Best baby food.  However, this brand is always more watery than any other brand I've tried.",4,1
"The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good.",5,1
"When I was pregnant I was sure I'd be one of those Moms who has both the time and inclination to make all her own baby food. And I did go that route for a while, until I realized how much money I was spending and how much food (once made) I was having to throw out. A friend had suggested Amazon Moms to me and we had already started getting our diapers via 'subscribe and save'. I decided to try this food and she loves it, I get other varieties than just the fruit and veggies, but my daughter enjoys all of them. I have even tasted most of them myself and they are fairly tasty.<br />Plus the company is a heavy contributor to Sesame Street...so when you buy their products, you are helping out PBS as well. Win Win.",4,1
"I first purchased this mustard at a local package store. I think the taste is wonderful. It is my favorite flavor of Jack Daniels mustard. It has an excellent blend spices similar to what you would find in a variety of Mexican food. It is not extremely hot, but this is what I prefer, a nice medium spicy flavor.",5,1
"I just made biscuits with sausage gravy.  I must say it's really good.  It's very close to the real thing for me!  I figured biscuits were the ultimate test, and they came out great.  I will be using this for lots of things.  I definitely want to try the chicken parm recipe!",5,1
"This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way, I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.",5,1
"I have tried all sugar substitutes and used Splenda for several years.  I had to give up Splenda due to a side<br />effect and someone recommended Xylitol.  This product is great, I use it in everything.  It tastes good, is a<br />natural sweetner, and has no bad after taste or side effect.  I don't really bake, so I cannot attest to its use<br />in baking but it is the best in everything else.",5,1
"My dogs love these. I love the 50-ounce boxes. This is a great product, free from bad preservatives, by-products and animal digest. Wellness is a wonderful brand that is tasty yet very healthy for dogs. These treats are a great bang for your buck in comparison to other dog treats. The price here online is the same as the price at the pet store, but I love the fact that I don't have to spend my gas money going to get it!",5,1
I add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great.  It tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when I get a cappuccino there.,5,1
"Stevia is great stuff, and this effervescent tablet form is both convenient and inexpensive.  Each tablet is roughly equivalent to half a teaspoon of sugar.  And stevia is completely plant-derived.",5,1

"Thai Kitchen makes one of the most visually appealing sweet chili sauces around.  Unfortunately, its merits end with its appearance.<br /><br />A good sweet chili sauce balances sweetness with a full-bodied chili burn.  One could argue that the Thai Kitchen sauce achieves balance because each side of that equation is a big 0.  There is no discernable sweetness.  And there is no burn.  In fact, foods to which I have added this sauce are unchanged by it.  I have used it in several different recipes just to ensure it was not overwhelmed by another ingredient.  It is consistently absent.<br /><br />Compounding the insult, the bottle says it must be refrigerated after opening.  This is the first of many sweet chili sauces I have used to make such a demand.<br /><br />I can only urge people looking for a sweet chili sauce to look elsewhere unless your only interest is in having a good looking bottle sitting on your shelf.",1,0
"I have made my own pockets by gouging snack treats but I prefer these for convenience. One of my cats has a sensitive digestion, but he has always done well with Greenies Pill Pockets. I usually use 1/2 to 1/3 of a pocket because they are gooey and he gets it stuck in his teeth (he looks like one of the Stooges eating a sandwich full of glue). Sometimes I glue a little pill he's been taking to the back of another kind of treat, using pocket material as putty. Also a small amount of pocket rolled around a vitamin tablet works well to convince him that what's good for him can also taste good!",5,1
"Nonni's uses real butter in this product as well as most if not all of their products.<br /><br />Premium ingredients for the flavorful Biscotti you want to enjoy and share with your friends.<br /><br />rich chocolate, to be savor with coffee or milk, for the entire family.<br /><br />Nonni's is top of the line in premium Biscotti.<br /><br />Enjoy, you'll be glad you did.",5,1
I recently tried this coffee after winning a sampler pack from their facebook page. Breakfast blend was the 1st that I tried and it was by far my favorite! Would definately recommend them to anyone and I love the company itself as well. They are a great customer based company!,5,1
"My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.",5,1
"Just packed in there with delicious oil and not salty at all.  I eat them plain with lemon and cook them into all kinds of meals.  I read other reviews about the can top breaking so I have always just been careful when opening them and had no problems yet.  I even feed the extra oil to my dog, he loves it!  Very similar to tuna in taste, not overly fishy probably because no skin.  A good buy at this price & I will do it again.",5,1
"My husband came over from the UK about ten years ago. When he first arrived here in the states there were very few companies importing at least from a retail product standpoint many of the things he missed.

"If I had an unlimited budget I would buy Green Mountain Dark Magic. Since I don't, the Coffee People Jet Fuel is just fine. My husband and I both like really strong coffee and we are happy with this. We also liked the Coffee People Wake-up call, but I think the Jet Fuel is better.",4,1
"OK, so I didn't know these were from China when I bought them and I really wish they weren't.  It's given me pause and I have yet to buy more.  That being said, they are DELICIOUS and I will most likely purchase again.",4,1
"Ginger Chews Originals are a good replacement to Ginger Snaps because its a little healthier and taste a little better too. The only issue is the freshness is a bit in question, (i ordered my batch from Puritans Pride, same exact product though) it didnt taste the absolute freshest but maybe thats just the way they taste normally, overall despite that id still give it a try if u love ginger... XDXD",4,1
"Not your typical milk chocolate.<br />Less overtly sweet, but just as smooth.<br />The sweetness is understated and the bold flavor make it a little closer to dark chocolate, but without the bitterness/bite.  If you are used to the very sweet, very mild taste of most commercial milk chocolates, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />My new favorite indulgence!!",5,1
See's candy is delicious. There were shops in California where I grew up.  Now I live in New England and there is no other way to get it except mail order. I'll take it! ;),5,1
This is a fabulous organic cat food.  Love that it has spinach in it.  My cats really love it. So glad to have found it.  Thanks Amazon!,5,1
"The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.",4,1
"I ordered these due to the increasing difficulty in finding the merrick 6-8"" flossies.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that my dogs (maltese and berger picard) LOVE these!  They last a little longer than the flosses, and the picard is very fussy about bully sticks - and these are his new favorite.  Have already ordered these again.",5,1
"Good tasting cookie.  Will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Very hard, though.  Definitely good for dunking in your coffee!",4,1
"My son really love this biscotti, also the rest of the family, of course. If you have costco membership, buy it at costco for less than $8!!",4,1
"Excellent flavor, great quality and 100% zabihah, would have given 5 stars but it is just a bit hotter than I expected, but still great!",4,1
"Much better than Nutrisystem. I bought the Nutrisystem plan for 8 weeks, less than half the food was edible, comparing this to their breakfast bar this is by far better tasting and it does make you feel full longer.",4,1
"I haven't tried these molds before, but they ran out before I could order it. The next time it comes back in stock I will get it then.",4,1
The bottle I got of this tasted terrible.  It smelled and tasted fruity...but not good fruity.  The taste didn't even resemble pumkin pie in the least.  It tasted strange!,1,0
"I like it. It has good fiber.  Plenty protein. Good price.  Only thing is the consistency is that of fine sand.  I don't taste anything but my girlfreind says it tastes like bad breath. I think it works best in smoothies but I mix it in water sometimes and it literally sinks to the bottom of the glass, I have to mix for every sip or I end up with green wet sand at the bottom of the cup when I am done. So best blended!",4,1
"This is very Bold and strong! Just the way I like it! No bitter after taste, just good coffee! It is good breakfast coffee for me. I like that Kick-start option.",5,1
"This is good green tea, bottom line. However, I'm used to Lipton green tea, I have never drank tea that is labeled as Japanese, so I don't have much to compare it to. This is better than Lipton's green tea, and it is not that expensive compared to other brands labeled as Japanese Green Tea. I say try it, you really don't have much to lose if you don't like it.",5,1
"I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies. They are certainly very gooey, but they are not at all chewy. They are also much smaller than most other Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies. They are very crumbly, and I am even tempted to leave them in the fridge to stiffen up. Like most other Chips Ahoy! packagings, the box has an easy resalable cover which will help keep the cookies fresh for as long as they last. Overall, these are good chocolate-chips cookies that add a new twist to this kind of sweets.",4,1
"I originally bought this bonsai tree as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  The shipping was great and the tree arrived very nicely secured in a box with wet soil and everything was great.  However, I'm not sure if it was the shock from the cold weather or the shipping or what, but the tree was dead upon arrival.  I then contacted the Amazon customer service and they got back to me right away.  They fixed the problem by sending me another tree which arrived quickly and was beautiful.  I then re-potted the plant as I felt that the pot was too small for it for the home, but a great way for the nursery to maintain all of the trees that it has and it is now flourishing.  So my advice is that if you feel that your tree isn't faring well, re-pot it so that the roots can spread out and grow.  I never let the soil get dry and my tree is doing great!  I personally feel that due to the fact that all bonsai trees are so finicky, that the shipping kind of shocks the plant, but the trees from this nursery are great!  I will definitely be ordering from them again!",5,1
"Firstly, I prefer my beans roasted slightly darker, this is very much a blonde roast.  But I could possibly re-roast these beans, however:<br /><br />My favorite coffee of all time was something sold by Starbucks called Komodo Dragon, and other coffees like it by Starbucks.  It is missing a bitterness I associate with acid in coffee, a bite that, in its absense, allows you to taste the coffee. The lack of that distracting bitterness leaves the coffee with overtones of chocolate and berries and, well, all of the good flavors of coffee.  I would drink the coffee hot, but more often cool, unsweetened, unflavored, since I found I could taste it much better when it was cool.<br /><br />A few years ago, Starbucks changed their coffee from ""Komodo Dragon"" to ""Komodo Dragon Blend"".  It was still very close in flavor to the original coffee, which I think was all from a limited area.<br /><br />But now it no longer has a good flavor.  It has that bitterness that used to be missing from most Indonesian Coffees and specifically Komodo Dragon and Blend.<br /><br />So I went off to try and find another decent coffee, something low acid, not bitter, and able to feed my five pound a month habit.<br /><br />This coffee was labeled as a ""very low acid coffee"". I had hope for it. I bought the smallest quantity I could see available, which was a five pound bag.<br /><br />This is not the coffee that will replace Komodo Dragon - it is not even close.  It is bitter, has the flavor of a central american washed coffee.  If that is a flavor you like, you might like this coffee.  Me?  I'm not going to buy another bag, and I will probably make 2-3 pots to see if I can stand drinking it at all-I am very close to declaring it undrinkable and returning it..I want to make sure that I am only tasting this coffee - I cleaned the grinder and all that but I will make at least one more pot to be sure I don't have any of the fail Komodo Dragon Blend in the pathway.  If that comes out as bad as this pot I will likely return it - or give it to a neighbor or some such.  Or drink it with some hazelnut syrup or even cardamom to mask the bitterness.  Because it is not that low acid, unbitter coffee that Komodo Dragon Blend used to be.<br /><br />And that is too bad.",2,0
"This is not a Goji berry review, this is a branded product review.<br />I found berries with dark spots which seemed like fungus. This happened with 2 separate bags with different batch numbers. I should have written down batch / lot numbers before throwing them.<br /><br />Note: I live in Ohio and product was ordered in cooler months. Storage was in refrigerator so I doubt that it was a storage issue from my end after opening the sealed pack. Will never buy this product.",1,0

"The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.",1,0
I have this every day with my salads. It's really good and the value is outstanding! Thanks Amazon!!,5,1
"This holder is awesome.  It works well, holds 35 k-cups & the quality is great.  We had another holder with pull out trays that didn't work out.  I read the reviews on this one & decided to try it and so glad I did.  The chrome also looks great with the coffee maker.",5,1
"I am in love with Essentia! This water tastes very smooth, and keeps me hydrated for a very long time. Living in a hot and humid environment, I need all the hydration I can get, and Essentia didn't let me down. I felt the effects within an hour-hydration anyway. I don't have any real health problems, and the idea that just water can cure health problems seems a bit much, and none of these claims have been proven. However, for a bottled water, I very much enjoyed this.<br /><br />While I should say the texture is smooth, and not thick, there is no odd aftertaste that most bottled waters give you. It tastes as I imagine pure drinking water should. This leaves behind no odd coating of the tongue that annoys me in most bottled waters, and it goes down very well. My mouth even feels more refreshed after drinking it!<br /><br />The price isn't too bad for what you get either. The bottles are insanely huge for a typical bottled water.<br /><br />I plan on buying more of this water, as it was even better, to me, than Smart Water, and I used to swear by them!",5,1
"This is a very difficult tea to find in most stores. However, when you can find it, it is an excellent refreshing beverage. It has just the right level of citrus flavor without being overpowering. Tartness is fairly mild. Makes an excellent iced tea as well (add just a little Splenda for the iced version - the tartness tends to go up when cold).",5,1
"The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and ""chewy"".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained ""stale"" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the ""treat"".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.",2,0

"I found this tasty candy on vacation, but alas there are some drawbacks to small town shopping.  That's why I was happy to find these available on Amazon. It is a very strong flavor, not sugared up for general consumption.  If you're a fan of the instense flavors found in Altoids, you'll appreciate Chimes.  The peanut butter may cut the bitterness of ginger, but in no way distracts from the intense flavor.  And when the candy is gone, you have a nifty tin for sewing notions, little bits of hardware, or any sundry of small things in need of a sturdy box in which to hold them.",5,1
"Unless the objective is a sugary flavor, stick with the original!  This ""Bold & Spicy"" is neither nor.  It's very dense which is nice for texture and variety, but it is so sweet, it ruins the drink.  It's hard to say where this ""bold"" jazz comes from-- to be frank, it's pretty bland.<br /><br />The original M&M T mix is far superior and there are many other brands that offer better flavor than this ""BS"" variation.  ;)",2,0
"This is a great-tasting, low fat product that is not available in the supermarkets in my area.  My favorite from Genisoy is the salt & pepper, but this product is right up there.

"I've used this to make both beef and venison jerky in a smoker with great results.  I like the cracked pepper and garlic flavor so much I don't even feel like trying other flavors or products.  Everybody has their own opinion of what the perfect jerky style/flavor is and this hits pretty close to my ideal, YMMV.  I've only used it with sliced meat but don't see any reason why it wouldn't work great with ground meat.<br /><br />The kit comes with a shaker, instructions, and two resealable bags - one of cure and one of seasoning.  Keep the instructions, they tell you the ratio of cure and seasoning for how much meat you have.  Make sure you use the right amount of cure. I like my jerky with a little more seasoning than what they call for.<br /><br />Just mix the correct ratio of cure and seasoning in the shaker and apply it evenly over all the surface of your sliced meat.  You want the cure to contact all of the meat's surface evenly.  Put the meat in a ziplock bag in the fridge for a day or two to cure(mix it around once in awhile to insure even distribution of the cure) and then it's ready to go to the smoker or dehydrator.  Very easy and it gets rave reviews.",5,1

"Yuck, yuck and yuck. I did not approve of these ""noodles"".  Smelled awful and the texture was chewy and tough...really disgusting.  Did not matter what type of sauce or soup I put them in, they were still gross.  I wasted my money on a 20 pack and expensive shipping.",1,0
I love this product but it is almost impossible to get it. I was thrilled when I found it here. Thanks for the fast service.,5,1

One shipment was so dry I had to add water to have a gravy. The last lamb shipment was mostly gravy & less meat. I would prefer the weight be made up of meat & not all gravy. But, the pups love it!

"I look for it in every supermarket to have in the pantry at all times.  I'm a ""from scratch"" cook most of the time, and fussy about flavor, but appreciate the convenience of this product.  It's helped me enormously in losing 50 pounds over the past 4 months, no kidding.  Instant flavorful soups out of leftover chicken/fish/veggies, or a quick healthy soup from fresh veggies or even frozen.  Great for making flavorful rice, substituting some or all of the usual water with this broth.  A little zing to poaching bland chicken or seafood.",5,1

These Belgain Truffles are the best chocolates on the planet! I have only been able to find them at Amazon.com. The company who shipped them is fabulous. They were concerned about shipping them to Florida because the hot weather would melt them. Luckily within the week a cool spell dropped down into SW FL so the chocolates were shipped. It's hard to eat just one! I would definitely order them again.,5,1

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I tried all the samples in the box when I first purchased my kuerig but there was only 1 or 2 that I really took a liking to. I like flavored coffees as I'm not a coffee purist and found this one to be very good. The vanilla flavor is smoothly blended into the coffee which makes for a nice smooth coffee. This will be my standard coffee from now on.,4,1
"We really enjoy Bold and Extra Bold Coffee so I bought a box of Crazy Cups Dark Roast Keurig Cups which has several different brands/kinds of dark roast coffee. Jet Fuel is by far the least tasty of the brews. The coffee was on the weak side for a Bold Blend, but had a burnt aftertaste. This coffee is not for those who enjoy a really rich, bold taste. So far, Dark Magic has been our favorite of the varieties in the box.",1,0
"This is absolutely the best jerky I have ever found.  It is getting harder & harder to find, thank goodness for Amazon.  I agree with other reviewers, the larger packages are better than the smaller because then seem to have the larger, better pieces.  Enjoy!",5,1

"These are the real deal. Pepper Companie has made these black jacks the same way since the 1800s. They are all hand pulled and delightfully irregular in size. The flavor is really strong of molasses. DELISH! They have a fabulous texture similar to a candy cane. Not super dense like a jolly rancher, they're more airy so you can bite them and chomp them down if you want.. (and trust me, you WILL want to) All of the pepper candy companie products are fabulous but these are my absolute favorite. I always stock up when I'm in Salem.",5,1
"i should have tried this flavor before buying bulk here.  my daughter loves puffs in general and she really liked the sweet potato ones we got before this one.  but the apple cinnamon flavor is a little too 'artificial' and strong. instead of grabbing them by the handful, she doesn't seem too interested to eat these..",2,0

The prescription food didnt' help the vomiting.  I did research and found this food to be grain free...and after feeding it to my cats they haven't vomitted since.<br />Next time you go to the pet store look on the back of every cat food and you will see the second ingredient as either rice, grain, corn, etc.<br />When was the last time you saw a tiger eating rice?

Results may vary of course :)<br /><br />This was my go-to bubble gum growing up, and will continue to be as I grow older.",5,1
"PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",5,1

Maurice Sendak is a wonder, and this little book of months and rhymes is absolutely silly and so much fun to read.

Very cute way to teach the months of the year (not to mention celebrating my own personal love of soup) and beautifully illustrated in the way only Sendak can.",4,1
"I purchased this food to give my shih tzu. We slowly introduced it by mixing it into his old food. Unfortunately my doggie can't tolerate it even though he loves it. We found that he'd vomit it up.<br /><br />So we switched to using this as a treat. He gets 5 to 10 little bits a few times a day as a reward. We still need to be careful. If we give him too many of the bits, he throws them up. But in the long run, a bag of this will last us a very long time and we will end up saving money on treats. And he loves the flavor!",4,1

However, when this one came, it was still the old style, I had the same experience as with the first one - it did not work! After contacting the company again, I was asked to return both units at my expense and they would send the newer style that was now available.<br />Now, I have been told that they will not send another product since shipping to Canada would be to costly, but instead refund my original purchase price without compensating my expense of returning two defective products. So how do I rate this products? I can't, it never worked to begin with. How do I rate the Seller? You draw your own conclusion.",1,0

"We have had the breville single serve coffee maker for several years now and have tried many different varieties of k cups.  My husband and I like our coffee strong enough for cream and sugar but dont like bitterness.  Jet Fuel is strong enough to use the larger cup size and still have great flavor.  It has no bitterness for such a strong cup of coffee.  I recently purchased and sent several boxes as gifts for family and friends who recently purchased kcup systems--my brother in law had been using the make your own k-cup with his ""fancy"" coffee beans but said the day he received these he ended up having 2 cups by 7:30 in the morning because it was so good--he had to stop himself from making more that day! I also love parisien nights by timothy's which has a slightly smoky/dark chocolate flavor and midnight magic which is slightly sweeter.  Jet Fuel is definitely one that we keep around all the time",5,1

"I was a little hesitant ordering the 6 pack - wondering if I should have spent less and just got a sauce from the store.<br /><br />This is a perfect sauce.  After using Redi Whip on my hot chocolate or cocoa, I drizzle the sauce over top and it it wonderful.  You can also use it before the whip cream.  I used to like marshmallows but whip cream and caramel sauce is decadent and a whole lot cheaper than going out and buying it.<br /><br />I am very happy with the purchase and it had a really good expiration date - not that they will last that long.",5,1

I got these for my girlfriend because she loves Twizzlers. I think she enjoyed them being larger because she can justify just having one or two and still getting twice as much candy. They are about 75% longer than a normal one so not quite double length. There are no other differences. Makes a good gift.,5,1

I will definitely buy these again.",5,1
"They taste fine, but don't be fooled by the package into thinking this is American-grown and natural. It all looks good - ""Woodstock Farms"" name, company based in Connecticut, bucolic image of a rustic farmhouse, ""Caring about the Land"" slogan, all the pseudo-natural, pseudo-green trappings companies use to hook you into buying a product that's not as good for you or the environment as you could wish. I doubt that Woodstock Farms has any actual control over how these pumpkin seeds are grown or processed, and we all know from the news that China isn't overly concerned with food quality control or truth-in-labeling. I will avoid all Woodstock Farms products from now on.<br />I will also not buy any more food products off Amazon unless it is explicitly stated where the food was grown.",1,0

"If you are already a fan of Earl Grey, you will be delighted by the exquisite bergamot in this amazingly bold black China and Ceylon tea blend presented in a beautiful, highly giftable tin box.<br /><br />This tea is available in 35 oz, 8.8oz, 4.4oz and tea bags; I usually get the 4.4oz tin to keep it the freshest. One tin of 4.4 oz is enough for ~100 cups (I use a 1.5' mesh infuser).<br />As usual with Kusmi, the tin is beautiful, with raised flower details and old-fashioned design and colors. Anastasia comes in the dark blue tin.<br /><br />The leaves are whole, a deep black with no other visible ingredients.<br />The nose is extremely bold: lots of bergamot, lime and orange blossom with a very sweet appetizing varietal black tea undertone.<br />The mouth is rich and full and the citrus notes are not acidic.<br />I brew this tea a little lighter than my other Kusmi teas (3-4 min- dark amber, vs my usual ~7min) as the intensity of the oils is strong. However, the tannins are low and the finish very smooth so it is hard to infuse too much. Itdoes not get bitter.<br />I do not add anything but my Mom likes a cloud of milk in hers. Sweeteners are not needed as it is so round in mouth.<br /><br />To my knowledge, Anastasia is the most popular of Kusmi teas. You can also pick it up from Dean and Deluca to avoid shipping or directly from the Kusmi website (where shipping is unfortunately expensive but the choices are ).<br /><br />Try this beautiful tea blend; it is a real luxurious treat!<br />Cheers!",5,1

"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.",1,0
"I brought these after buying a bundle of 6"" Lucky Bamboo for my fishtank then realising that the poor lucky bamboo was way too short! (I was drowning it...) BUT! I was still able to use them and make a handful of beautiful arangements; which when these came half was added to my tank (my tank is short) and the other half went into improving the shorter arrangements I started! - Ohh! and I got a free bottle of plant food! If I ever need more Lucky Bamboo I'll know where to go!<br /><br />Side Note:<br />One thing although kinda bugged me when I got this set of bamboo compared to the last one, the center and the roots where covered with this werid clear-jello looking stuff. It kinda creeped me out, and took a while to wash off, I assume it was something to keep the lucky bamboo from drying out, but after a good wash it was gone, and it didnt kill my fish, so all is well!

They were fantastic with and without the frosting! I got the original recipe off of Food TV's website, made it and the end product tasted exactly the same as the boxed one I'd made.

It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn't even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That's all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink.",2,0
"We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite. They don't get messy like other chew treats and her breath smells so much better, even better than the dental milkbones out there. She really does prefer these over any other dog treat.",5,1
"I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30. I'll try to remember to update this after he finishes it :)<br /><br />P.S. he also has MUCH less gas. win-win for both Leonidas and myself (but more for myself)",5,1
"howdy y'all,<br /><br />when you can get this from amazon with free shipping [can't do that right now, unfortunately] it's a dang fine deal. i got the regular flavor and one package is just the right amount to take the edge off my craving. it's really too salty for me to have often, but _wow_ is it good. [*grin*]<br /><br />my big box of 64 packages has lasted me quite some time - since 2010-10 - and it will last a few more weeks. yes, it's past the use-by date. it still tastes fine to me. none of the packs i received were crushed, either.<br /><br />rated a FOUR cuz this item is actually better than i had expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee",4,1
"This is my dogs favorite canned dog food, am so glad I can purchase it online now, the stores don't bother to carry it all the time",5,1
"Excellent quality. Tart, not sweet. Only one pit in whole box. Subscribe price is unbeatable. Why pay high grocery store prices?",5,1
"As a relatively new Keurig user (former Senseo user), I have been trying various flavored coffees along with regular pods.  This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy",4,1
Ordering from Olde Naples Chocolate was great.  The chocolate was for my mom and she loved it.  It arrived exactly when they said it would.,5,1
My little Jack Russel loves these perfectly sized biscuit.  Unlike other's they don't break apart.  She loves them.  I love them.  No itching or tummy problems.,5,1
"Macadamia nuts are expensive so the product is also expensive. It tastes reasonably good. I add a little Splenda on top of the spread. While it IS pretty good, I think I will order just cashew butter next time.",4,1
"Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients. Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity. I needed a cat food that is grain free (for the fat kitty) and low carb (for the diabetic kitty). If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage, then Wellness is a great choice.",5,1
"Old London Garlic Bagel Snacks are really good.  Cannot find this flavor in any grocery store in New Orleans, but found them at Amazon and I'm delighted.",5,1
"I have tried the GF cc cookies-very dissappointed!  I followed the recipe, used real butter, baked on a cooled cookie sheet, but my cookies came out flat, thin and super sweet.  I have made several different GF cookies that taste great and resemble a cookie, but this recipe isn't the one Betty Crocker!  I will have to keep making mine from scratch!  GF Brownies are awesome though!",2,0
Super yummy! Really hits the spot when I want a chocolatey snack that won't break the calorie bank.,5,1

"Licorice Spice is a great tea. A touch of spicy and sweet. Not boring.<br /><br />I tried it when I visited an up-town supermarket, but when I ran out and wanted another box I discovered that its not available at my local grocery store! Hooray for lazy internet shopping!",5,1
Second time ordering this tea and it does wonders...i add to my light wworkout routine and I've been losing just about 3lbs a week,5,1
"The school where I work has a ""popcorn day"" one Friday per month.  The popcorn is popped in a theater-type popper.  They use the Act II Buttery flavored oil and the Act II butter flavored salt.  I don't know how others who gave such poor reviews are popping their corn, but our popcorn is fabulous!  It is a huge hit at school, both with the kids and the adult staff.  We have families who buy enough for every member of the family for a movie and popcorn night.  Maybe others are not measuring it correctly, or are not using the right popper.  I don't know.  All I can say is I love this stuff!!  I smell it being popped all day and can't wait to eat it!!  It takes all my willpower to keep from eating a bag of it for lunch!<br /><br />If you use the Act II salt with the oil, be careful not to use too much of the salt.  It seems to be concentrated.  It doesn't take as much as you might think.<br /><br />If I could have these people send me their supply that they obviously don't know how to use, I'd be in heaven!<br /><br />I'm buying myself a theater-style popper for Christmas, just so I can have this popcorn more often than once a month!",5,1
I just bought some of these chocolate cookies from the local health food store.  They are really good!  I love the crunchiness.  My three year old really likes them (and he has a preference for Oreos) Will be ordering from Amazon in the future because the price is so much better.,5,1
"I've been hooked on Special K since I was in high school (I'm 25).  I've gone from the regular cereal, to Special K with Strawberries, and now I'm hooked on Protein Plus.  There is just something naturally sweet and tastey about this cereal- I eat it at least once per day.  And you can't beat the price!  I subscribed to it on Amazon, and get it delivered for $2.50 per box.  In the grocery store, when I can find it, it is $4.50+ per box.  Love it, and love Amazon!",5,1
They where so good i ate them all in less then 24 hours with my other friend.,5,1
"This product is great. Its got a few different ingredients than PB2 which are going to appeal to a big chunk of people in the health food community.<br /><br />PB2 is made with peanuts, sugar, and salt. This is made with organic peanuts, organic coconut sugar (which is supposed to have a lower glycemic index and for the record does not taste like coconut in the slightest), and sea-salt. I'm not certain how much the glycemic index of the sugar matters when it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving (PB2 has 1 gram), but then again I'm not diabetic and I thought it might be a useful thing to point out.<br /><br />Overall unless you are a strong subscriber to the ""Organic over Conventional"" debate I'm not sure this product is more nutritious than PB2. It has an extra gram of sugar and a gram less of protein and fiber per serving. Of course this is a huge improvement over normal organic peanut butter let alone peanut butter from any of the major brands. So if the two products are more or less the same nutrition wise purchasing would come down to flavor and price.<br /><br />This product is a bit more expensive than PB2. Thats probably due to the organic factor and scale. Organic ingredients cost more to produce and more to buy, but also PB2 has a jump start on branding and is in more stores (or at least it seems to be) so its distribution network may run more efficiently, it may be able to produce larger batches at lower costs, and overall its going to be a bit cheaper. So don't write this product off now and forever because of the price. If you try it and like it support it and the price may come down.<br /><br />Finally flavor and texture. This product tastes like peanut butter there's no getting around that. Its rich and almost creamy when you mix it up. It can add a peanut butter flavor to protein shakes, yogurt, muffins, cookies, etc. In short its fully customizable and how you use it is up to you and your preferences. I've read that a lot of people have to ""learn to like"" PB2. I didn't have that experience, but if you did or are having trouble learning to like it give this one a try. I'm not sure what it is exactly maybe the coconut sugar (which again doesn't taste like coconut), but it does taste a little different than PB2. I don't have much of a preference either way and friends that have tried both seem more or less split in their opinions (when they have one).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />It tastes great<br />It can be used in many ways and mixed to any consistency<br />It uses organic ingredients and coconut sugar (unlike PB2)<br />But its nutritional stats aren't quite as good (1 more gram sugar, 1 less gram fiber and protein)<br />Its a bit more expensive than PB2<br /><br />I love it, but you'll have to decide how you weight organic ingredients vs nutrition stats vs price, in any case if you want to replace your normal PB but don't like PB2 its worth a try",5,1
I LOVE the Sassafras kits.  I have bought about 18 of them in the last few years for gifts.  There are many of them for boys and girls if you just search Sassafras they will pull up.  I always buy a book that coordinates with the kit that is a reader book since most of the gifts have gone to 5 and 6 year olds.  I have never had any shipping issues and they have always come bubble wrapped and in great shape.  These are really fun and cute.  I have 7 in a closet right now because with 3 kids there is always a birthday party to go to!,5,1
"Delicious chocolate candy, ideal for snacks for toddler. They can open it themselves and it is small enough so they can hold it in their hands. My 2 year old has 2 of those in the car on the way back from preschool and he can manage to open it and eat it by himself. Delicious taste (I tried it more than once!).",5,1
This stuff is awesome. If you love hot but still want to be able to enjoy the flavor then this is the salsa you want. I actually picked it up online from Walmart because it was only 20 bucks for the 6 pack of 16 oz jars and I ordered enough that shipping was free.,5,1
"Several companies now have products called Chicken Poppers.  However, what I like about these is that they aren't at all greasy.  I have to be careful what I give my dogs because one gets Pancreatitis very easily and the other is a little piggy so I have to watch how much he eats.  These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.  I'm sure they taste quite good as well, considering how quickly the little popper disappears.",5,1
These are great treats for dogs. My bichon is 14 pounds but this is a good size treat for her and the fact that they promote dental health is a bonus.,5,1
"I have a VEEEEERRY fussy 2 year old Ragdoll cat who cannot eat dry food (it makes him throw up) and he hates most all canned foods.  (And I know, because I have tried them all!)  Thankfully, I found this food before he starved to death!!!  He really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he NEVER did that before!)  The food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little ""rectangle"" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy.  I am very happy with the ingredient list, and the fact that it is a high-quality, nutritious, premium food for my fussy boy!",5,1
"Foamy, mixes easy, somewhat sweet raspberry taste (not so much pomegranate).  Hard to tell from just one how much of a boost.",4,1
These jelly beans tasted like the real thing.  The kids had fun tasting the different and some disgusting flavors (like dirt flavor for example).  I ordered more boxes!,5,1
"My dogs love them, and my 9-year old chocolate lab doesn't get sick from them.  All other rawhide chews hade her sick!  My 5-month old chocolate lab loves them also, as he is a big chewer!!!",5,1

"I love to cook in Coconut oil It Taste Great I Have Tried others and don't like them I will keep buying this product. Great in eggs,baking,they say its good for you to.",5,1
"I wondered when Amazon might get around to offering this product. I've loved eating these basic fried and dehydrated noodles for decades, and will be glad to order them by the case. These simple noodles are great with tons of Tabasco--quick and satisfying.<br /><br />The instructions are plain silly, though. My family has always prepared these noodles this way: 1. boil water in a pot, 2. add in the soup base, 3. add in the noodles, and then cook them together till the noodles are soft enough to eat (I like them slightly undercooked). Cooking the noodles in the soup base makes them taste better. Do not overcook, and do not let noodles sit in soup for too long while eating (e.g., longer than half an hour), or noodles will become too soft and fat.<br /><br />Then I pull the noodles out first and douse them with hot sauce--so the hot sauce will cling to the noodles as well as the soup--and then pour in the soup. That vinegary Tabasco taste mixed with the salty noodles and soup is very good. The noodles are also good with an egg--cracked into the pot after the soup base, and cooked together with the noodles.",5,1
"I have been a huge fan of Big Red for years.  They changed the flavor last year and I cannot stand it at all.  It just tastes bad.  Hopefully, Wrigley's will bring us Big Red Classic Flavor, but I'm not holding my breath.",1,0
"This pricing is a nice little savings compared to purchasing it at the Vet's office, and when you have a kitty on a prescription diet the cost can really add up.  Our 15 year old kitty with CRF loves this food and eats it with enthusiasm, so we're hoping he'll gain a bit of weight as well as a bit more time with us.  Worth it!",5,1
"The Pasta and Cheddar was wonderful, as always. It allows my wife, who is Gluten sensitive, to have mac and cheese, which she loves. My complaint lies in the packaging. I had indicated that the item was a gift, yet the package arrived with the contents boldly indicated on the box. It also had the invoice openly displayed, which I had requested not be done. In short, LOVE the product, but the packaging policies need to be reviewed.",4,1
"First let me say that I was concerned about getting all those dented cans, but it appears that Amazon fixed that problem by putting the case in a box so they were fine.  Only one can was slightly dented, no big deal.  The taste at first is ""yuck"" kind of like eating grass or weeds, then you get more used to it.  I drink it because it's good for you and not because it tastes so awesome.  And I am a fan of caffeine without drinking coffee, which I hate. Also like the anti-oxidant factor.  My boyfriend who is into health likes it too, likes ice tea but wants to eliminate the sugar.  I have another case coming soon, I got on the automatic shipment plan where you save a few bucks if it automatically comes to your house every month or so.  So yes I will continue to drink this, not every day, but in place of Lipton or other sweetened teas, I never liked packaged ice tea but this product is a good healthy alternative.",4,1
"Pros:<br />-Good first 5 ingredients: Organic Chicken, Water, Chicken Liver, Salmon, Ocean Whitefish<br />-My cat likes it better than Newman's Turkey and Vegetables formula<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Expensive (but organic)<br />-A top pick for my cat, but noticeably not as much as her favorite: Natural Balance (similar top 5 ingredients: Chicken, [Water], Chicken Liver, Duck, Salmon)<br /><br />So in the organic category, this is a 5-star pick. But if you're willing to go non-organic consider Natural Balance.<br /><br />Here's another food review as well:<br />http://www.consumersearch.com/cat-food",5,1
"I have ordered the liquid coffee creamers in the past, and they always leak during shipment. The powdered coffee cream arrived perfectly and tastes good, this is my 2nd favorite next to the vanilla caramel.",5,1
"I have tried half of the flavors so far, and every one of them has tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD! for a package of snack food that has very little crap in it, i'm really surprised at how great they taste. I would definitely buy this stuff again. Hope they make more products like this!!",5,1
"I love this pasta. It is endorsed by the ""Best for Life"" stamp too.  It has high fiber and OMEGA 3's too.  I have one bowl of this thin spaghetti for dinner with tomato sauce.  I've been doing this for about 6 weeks, and I have managed to lose 17 pounds eating pasta!",5,1
"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!",5,1
"I'm more of a tea drinker but occasionally want something different and I like this to keep me up or wake me up too. So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one.",5,1
Sprout seed mix arrived very promptly and in great condition.  I needed them for our local farmers market and will be ordering more very soon.,5,1
Very flavorful and yummy! Much better than regular peanut butter. Nice texture as well. Thanks for such a good product.,5,1

"These treats are good for dogs, all natural and yummy! My black lab loved them and went through one a day! Hopefully they helped with her hips!",5,1
I have enjoyed this coffee even though it is a little bolder than what I am used to and I will probably buy more for when I have guests who prefer a strong coffee!,5,1
"Everyone I know that uses a pod brewer at home or work loves it. Fresh coffee made to order, endless variety, no waste, etc. It is a shame that so many settle for the coffee pods made by big commerical roasters like Melitta and Douwe Egberts. The blends used by these big companies are bland and boring compared to all the great coffees offered by smaller roasters. Having had the opportunity to taste a variety of pods, I hope the list below of my favorites is helpful. Many of these are also much better coffee at a lower price! Many of the pods listed below are around 30¢ per pod, while the Senseo pods are over 31¢.

"The best oat bran I have ever had so far! It makes my oat bran muffins taste great. All the people who tried them said so. First I thought the bran was too coarse, but the muffins came out just right. I bought two packages, so it will last me a while . I will definitely buy again.",5,1
Probably our favorite of all the Kind bars we have tried.  My daughter does not eat a lot in the morning but she will eat these.  Thank you Kind Bars!,4,1

"My dogs are very tiny and I needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain, and these did great, plus my dogs enjoyed them. If a dog doesn't like the taste and won't chew on a dental stick, then it would defeat the purpose. So these fit the bill all around.",4,1
"I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but this does not make a good 8 oz cup like most other K Cups that I've tried.  I've had to reduce it to a 4 or 6 oz cup size to get a cup of coffee that is not like coffee flavored water.  I like a medium cup of coffee - not too strong or too weak.  I generally like the Green Mountain brand, but this is a weak, flavorless K Cup (and I have tried many, have found very few bad ones).",2,0
"While traveling in Ireland 12 years ago I discovered this excellent tea.  My European husband and I both love it......his with milk, mine with a little sugar.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon and order it regularly as needed.",5,1
I'm so glad to see Hodgson Mills products here!  The Whole Wheat<br /><br />Gingerbread Mix is wonderful. But the price from Hodgson Mills is $9.70 for the case of 6 and their shipping is reasonable. Maybe Amazon's prices for Hodgson Mills will come down in time.,5,1
"Since this is an extra thick fillo, it damages faster than other things, and the freezing pack that they include in the packaging was not enough and the fillo come spoiled.",2,0
"I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste ""weight"" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.",5,1
"Didn't like the taste of this coffee at all, would not purchase it again. Have had much better decaf coffee. I think the price was high for the coffee since the taste was so bad, Green Mountain should try to improve their decaf coffee's taste because right now it stinks!!!!!",2,0
Purchased this instant coffee for the office. It is working super and sooo much better than the other brands of instant coffee.,5,1
"I do like Rockstars, I'll admit, but I don't think you can beat these 5 hour energies.  They just do their job without jacking you up high then crash low.  I like Grape the best, the others are a bit faker tasting.  I would have given 5 starts, but truthfully the fake sugar is nasty, but it's over in a few seconds or just get a water chaser.  I'm sure they'd be super nasty without fake sugar and real sugar makes you crash - can't have it both ways.  It's nice to have a stock of these in the bottom drawer for times of need.  Beats the hell out of prices at the store.",4,1
"These cookies are fantastic! They're not too sweet, and not loaded with chocolate like other products. Tons of chocolate in a cookie doesn't necessarily mean that it'll taste better. I like soft cookies, and these have a nice texture and don't fall apart when I bite into them.",5,1
"I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing.<br />I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc.<br />Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference.<br />To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea.  I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way.  I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do.",5,1
"One of the worst things I have ever tasyed that was supose to be drinkable. Under fizzed and over chemicalled. My Grand children tasted it and got sick. Nothing like the real ""Fizzies"" of old. Reccogmended only for suicides to hide the taste of the poison-naw it might make you throw up and screw up the suicide attempt. They only sell it in large quantities because after tasting one no one would ever buy a second one.",1,0
What can I say! I love peanuts M&M's. I love them more than the regular kinds. They're filling and tasty. I got one of those M&M gumball machines and filled it up with this. I just love them. Go M&M's!,5,1
"We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.",5,1
"These are so good.  Even my husband with eat them and he will not eat any fruit.  I love that they can be tossed in a gym bag or purse and won't be smashed at the end of the day.  Sure, a whole apple might be a little better for you, but these sure beat other snacks if you are looking for a little chewy, tart snack.",5,1
"As far as taste goes, they all come running when they hear me opening the package.  I can't vouch for the teeth cleaning properties, as it appeared to me they were mostly swallowing them after a couple of bites.  I keep snacks to a minimum to prevent obesity.  What we need is a flavorful chew for cats they could mouth real well.  I have a couple that would chew them, cleaning their teeth without a lot of calories.",4,1
The product worked well to thicken juice from a dish.  It would have been better to have suggested directions on its use for someone like myself who has never used it before. Dissolve in a bowl and then add to the dish.,4,1
"I bought these in preparation for long nights during finals week with the thought that they may be more interesting than the typical chicken ramen noodles. I like spicy food too, so this seemed like an interesting trial for me, although a bit of a gamble when ordering a whole case. These noodles are fantastic, they have so much more flavor than typical ramen, and in many ways are much better tasting than the typical meals i eat.

Ton's of flavor, a bit more volume, and no MSG like normal ramen noodles. Highly recommended.",5,1
"I'd been curious about seaweed snacks for quite some time.  After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.<br /><br />The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.<br /><br />There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.<br /><br />Made in Korea.<br /><br />If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com. If interested in iherb, you can use code LEK375 for a discount.",4,1
"After a careful review of the Amazon page, I could find NO mention of mineral oil as the first ingredient in this product.  I do not use mineral oil on my hair, thus I will not be using this product on my hair.<br /><br />While the ingredients listed on the Amazon page sound good (i.e., ""a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm""), mineral oil is the main, unlisted, ingredient.  If you want mineral oil for your hair, it's easy to run down to the local pharmacy and pick up a bottle.<br /><br />Not for me!",1,0
"After falling in love with Kona coffee while in Hawaii we tried finding some back on the East Coast that wouldn't break our wallets like the 100% Kona would.

A good deal.",4,1
"I've purchased this product several times with different sellers/stores.  Seems I can find it cheaper here.  My dog who is great dane/pit bull mix loves his rope.  It's his favorite toy and lasts about 6 months or longer depending on how much he chews on it.<br /><br />I recently purchased this for a Secrat Santa Dog gift event, and my recipient loved this rope toy.  I've heard from other large dog owners that this is one of the best, longest lasting rope toys out there.  Great for cleaning dogs teeth and playing tug.  It is a little heavy and you have to be watchful about playing with it near small children and flat screen tvs.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it for other owners of large dogs.",5,1

"These are a little more crumbly than some of Nana's other cookies that I tried before I found out I should be on a gluten free diet.  But, they are a whole lot better than any I've been able to bake on my own.  They are good and spicy...just the way I like my gingerbread.  :-)",4,1
"Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say ""gentle kick"", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.",4,1

"This shake was one of the last shakes I could find that was both energizing, good for me (especially the non-gluten part), and helped me gain weight. I recently had 2 surgeries, and was looking forward to using orgain to get better. Had I known they were going to completely botch the formula, I would've ordered 10 cases beforehand.<br /><br />But I order 3 cases a month ago... and they were so undrinkable i assumed we got a bad batch of spoiled ones. But there were 3 separate cases like this... with the individual drinks inside tasting 'spoiled'. The expiration date seemed okay.<br /><br />Well, now its clear that the product wasn't spoiled... the formula was spoiled.<br /><br />I'm just so, so disappointed. Orgain had become a major supplement towards my health and recovery process after an injury I sustained last year and was hoping it would continue to be so during my recovery phase after the surgery.<br /><br />That's the type of mindset this drink was created for, right? A doctor made it because he knew the need for healthy, essential amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and organic blends to help someone gain weight, especially if they're been sick? A formula he concocted after beating cancer? Why not stick that??<br /><br />Am very disappointed to see this cheap change destroy the product that the brand was about.<br />Why should anyone prefer this over any other pre-made drink other than its hypoallergenic aspects? Many of the younger, healthier guys who're drinking this because it was simply better for you ounce for ounce than other mixes... well, good luck keeping them now. Especially with the huge change in taste. Just... augh. You can't even get it down.<br /><br />Am very sad to see such an amazing product be gutted without warning to its loyal consumers. If there really is a Doctor out there in charge of this company... well, I hope you still have a say in it, that you're reading these reviews, and hopefully that you'll evaluate your altered product for yourself and decide whether or not its something you would've preferred to the old orgain when you were recovering and rebuilding healthy mass. I imagine you would say - ""no"" - the old orgain was far more beneficial.<br /><br />I'm now looking for a new supplement shake. Very sad to see the old Orgain go.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions for other similar brands?",1,0

"I swear a box of these lasted for three days between my boyfriend and me.  It's a very tasty snack and I don't normally like caramel popcorn.  For the price, I would prefer the popcorn just in a large bag inside so I could put whatever amount I wanted in sandwich bag.  I find all this ""convenience"" packaging a bit hard for my green side to take.  I don't think I would buy this item due to its price, even when it is on sale at my local grocery.  They had them two boxes for $5 which comes out to 50 cents a bag.  If I bought a bag of popcorn or even popped it at home, I could make a bag of it to take on trips for a fraction of the cost.  Overall, the box did disappear in my household rather fast, so if you don't mind extra packaging and want to pay a bit more for the convenience, then this is probably a product for you if you like popcorn as much as I do.",5,1

"Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored.

"As of Nov 2007, each 16 gram serving contains 2 grams of trans fat!  That is 1/8th trans-fat by weight, and more than 1/8 by calories!!!  (Please consult the packaging for more current information, many manufacturors are removing trans-fat. Beware: they may legally claim 0 grams of trans fat when they have half a gram PER SERVING, which is very significant for small serving sizes.  So you should look for the words ""partially hydroginated"" in the ingredient list.  If you see ""partially hydrogenated"" then you know the product has artificial trans fat and you should NOT buy it.)<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is bad, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,""<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field.

I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it.

The tortilla soup is very good and I agree that if you follow the directions for preparation and stir well and wait 6  minutes while all the flavors marry, you'll have yourself a nutritious, delicious lunch or snack. Can't go wrong for just 200 calories (the whole cup). Heck, you could even add a handful of your own crushed tortilla chips and still have a lo-cal, good-for-you meal.",4,1
"After trying different citrusy flavors of gum (including Orbit Citrus Mint, Orbit Sangria Fresca, Orbit Fabulous Frutini, Extra Fruit Sensations Island Cooler, Trident Tropical Twist, and Stride Always Mandarin), I have concluded that Stride Forever Fruit takes the crown.<br /><br />There is a real burst of flavor (and natural-tasting sweetness) as you pop a piece in your mouth, and although it doesn't last ""forever,"" it definitely holds its own against each of the flavors mentioned above.<br /><br />Feel free to conduct your own taste test to find your own favorite, but I suggest you take my suggestion to try Stride Forever Fruit.  Who knows...you may realize that you won't even want to try any others!",5,1
"I gave my 4 cats these treats one night. They were still there in the morning, completely untouched. I brought them to my friends house to see if her cats liked them. We gave them to her 4 cats and only one liked them. So 1 out of 8 cats approved. Not a good ratio.",1,0
"H. Mitchell, I suspect you're joking about the granola providing you only 2 servings, but the back of the package suggests 3/4 cup per serving for a total of 6 servings.  I love the taste and texture of the ingredients, the delicate flavor, the gratification I get from knowing it will keep me satisfied until lunchtime.  Good job, whoever designed the granola.",5,1
"I was pleasantly surprised by this drink.  It really doesn't have any added sugar, and the flavor is very natural.  The carbonation is light, so if you're looking for something with a lot of kick, this might not suit you.  But I think it compliments the fruit flavor nicely.<br /><br />Two things took me aback:  First, that the can was just a bit over 8oz, which is small for those of us used to normal-size carbonated beverage cans.  And second, in spite of having no added sugar, it's really quite sweet.  I found it almost too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />It's a nice change from soda, but given the amount you get for the price, I don't think it's a great deal.",4,1
"I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad.",1,0
"Chips were fresh and securely packaged. It was not cost effective to pay retail and have to wait for delivery. Where was the advantage...other than to compensate for poor distribution throughout their stores? I like the chips (especially the cheese) and will continue to buy them. They are very pricy, so I will by them when I see them.",4,1
"These are good. I like that they are organic, and my 2 year old loves them. They do melt if dropped, so sometimes a pain to have to scrape off the floor, but they are nice to take on the go. Excellent flavor, not chalky tasting at all. I eat them myself!",4,1
"I used these to decorate a cake for my son's Lego themed birthday party. The kids liked it. It tastes a bit like Sweet-Tarts. It's pretty hard, and may be a little tough for little kids to chew.",4,1

"I love the regular Sleepytime tea, so I was excited to try this.  It was wonderful- the jasmine adds a really nice flavor. I love that I get my green tea in easily this way- and it is not bitter in the least.  (I'll note the Sleepytime vanilla was too sweet and mild for me.) But, I found it at almost 1/3 of the price doing a google search.",5,1
Living a low carb lifestyle is tough for a pasta lover.  However this is wonderful.  Even my husband who is very picky when it comes to low carb substitutes can't tell the difference.  We even break these up and use them in our beef stew (for the larger noodles).  I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the taste of this product!,5,1
"These are great little meals on the go. I'm a truck driver, and it's nice to have something shelf stable and easy to prepare. It doesn't get any easier than bowling water and pouring it in a cup.  The flavor is good, and the size is good. My sister doesn't like them.. says they are too watery, but I like them.  Not too expensive to try out for yourself. Hope this helps.",4,1
This is a great treat which all three of my dogs absolutely love!  I am now ordering it regularly and the price is great.,5,1
Bought this a month ago for $17.97.  Same price two months ago.<br />Now it suddenly goes up over $10.<br /><br />nice.  no thanks,2,0
"I will start off by saying these things are downright addicting.  I eat a packet or two every day and I highly recommend them.  They are just the right amount of sweet and don't taste like candy.  I really enjoy them.  I do not however, feel $60/box is fair.  You can find them MUCH cheaper at your local grocery store.  Enjoy!",5,1
"Initially, I was a little disappointed in this bonsai tree. It was a little smaller than I expected and looked a little more fake than I had hoped, but with a little work it worked out well. The ends between the trunk and the branches looked very fake as they are a green plastic color. I took a brown sharpie and did a little color work on them and it looked much better. Some of the plastic leaves also looked very fake, but I used some sharpies on those too to add a little color and it looked much more real and turned out to be a nice looking bonsai for the money. The moss at the bottom of the trunk is nice looking and a very good touch which adds to the overall appearance. The trunk of the tree is fairly nice looking, but I also did some touch-up work on it with the sharpies, which made it look better too.<br /><br />So the bottom line on this product is that it is fairly inexpensive, but for the money, and with a little effort on your part, this can be a decent looking artificial bonsai, and it is definitely easier to keep alive than a real tree! If you are on a budget or looking for something which is easy to care for, this is a decent option for you. Not the best, but good for the money. 4 Stars.<br /><br />Bohdi Sanders, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979676460"">Wisdom of the Elders</a>",4,1

"The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in.",5,1
My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :),5,1
Twinings English Breakfast Tea is one of the BEST cups of tea I've had in years. I have not had any problems with tea leaves in my cup as some other reviewers mentioned...just the perfect cup of tea every time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5,1
"I really like the taste of these little cookies, and this is the best flavor (IMO).  I got these when they were marked down to $12 and felt like I was paying an OK price.  They have gone back up in price, so waiting for it to come back down so that I can buy more.",4,1
I must admit that this is a bad temptation but I have always really like the flavor of planters peanuts.<br /><br />These come at a fair price and it is an easy way to stock up where you will not go broke.,4,1
This is a real good ham soup base.  It comes in two forms powder and gel.  I bought both.  I have used Gel base before from another company.  But I like this Gel base base better. I have used it in Ham and Beans and in Seasoned Green bean.,5,1
"I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!",5,1
My 10-yr old Golden Retriever had been having arthritis problems in his front leg. He's been on the Healthy Motion chewables for about a month now and I've seen a noticable difference. No limping and an extra pep in his step! I highly recommend this product for senior pets!,5,1
"I started feeding my 17-year-old cat Weruva a little over a year ago when she got bored with her old food. She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling ""Give it to me NOW"" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br /><br />Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br /><br />A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br /><br />Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet. But given the whole timeline, I simply cannot believe Weruva wasn't the biggest factor.<br /><br />Weruva because weluvya? Don't think so!",1,0
My daughter loves these.  They are so cheesy and convenient.  She loves to microwave one when she gets home from school to tie her over until dinner is ready.  I will definitely purchase these again.,5,1
I ordered this after hearing other moms talk about using coconut oil on their babies' bottoms instead of typical diaper rash cream.  The antifungal/antibacterial properties really do prevent rashes.  Our baby had already had 2 yeast rashes in his first 3 weeks after birth so I ordered this coconut oil and use it every other diaper change or when he looks red.  He has been 100% rash free for the last 4 weeks.  Also tried it out on my other son's dry chapped cheeks- worked great! I suffer from psoriasis and am considering adding some of this oil to my baths- you can't beat the fresh coconut smell either.,5,1
I tried them all and this is just as good as 5HR ES and at 1/2 the price.<br />If you are looking to replace 5HR ES then this is the only choice i have found so far. All i can tell you is i have it setup for auto delivery after i bought the first 12 pk.<br /><br />also...I just bought a case (regular strength...they don't make ext strength) from Sams Club (Members Mark brand)and that was just as good as reg 5HR @ $23 a case (24)...kinda wish they would do an ES but i am very happy with this product and free ship :),5,1

I was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items I've purchased for the Keurig have been awful. I was pleasantly pleased with this!  It is simply delicious!  I will definitely reorder!,5,1
"I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I prefer a robust and gritty coffee.  This was a light and smooth flavored coffee.  It was easy to drink and would be an acceptable coffee to the majority of casual coffee drinkers.  I could not taste the floral or exotic berry that the package promised but that did not matter to me.  I feel good that this is a fair trade coffee but all of the packaging makes this product not too environmentally friendly.  Overall, I would buy this coffee for a reasonable price but would serve it to guests who do not prefer my type of coffee.",4,1

"Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.

Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]",5,1
I wanted to find the same popcorn used in bars & at the movie theater and THIS IS IT! This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had!

"We've been feeding our dogs BLUE products since they were puppies. We have two Boston Terriers; Boston's have notoriously sensitive digestive systems and are very prone to gas.  A diet without corn, wheat and soy (as well as no by-products) is best for them. (FYI- chicken by-products include head, feet, beaks, lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, stomach, bones, blood, intestines, and any other part of the carcass not fit for human consumption)  Our dogs LOVE it and I feel good feeding it to them.  I know that they are getting human grade foods; quality chicken, anti-oxidant rich fruits (blueberries,cranberries), healthy veggies (tomato,whole potatoes,sweet potatoes,peas,whole carrots) as well as high quality grains (brown rice,barley,oatmeal,rye,flaxseed).  BLUE also has glucosamine for healthy joints; sunflower & fish oils for a natural source of Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids. Essential amino acids (L-carnitine and L-lysine) for fat metabolism, calcium absorption and the building of muscle. The BLUE-exclusive Life Source Bits have vitamins, minerals and holistic supplements like rosemary, garlic, kelp, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, yucca, turmeric and chicory root. BLUE also adds healthy digestion-promoting cultures - lactobacillus, acidophilus, Bacilus subtilis and enterococcus faecium. Dogs love it and it's good for them - what else could you ask for?  (It's also available in an economical 30 lb. bag, too.)",5,1

This tin of assorted Rugelach was exactly what we wanted to give my father.<br />His Grandmother used to make Rugelach for the Jewish holidays and this just about as close as you can get without being homemade.  A different and tasty treat.  Very fresh and they were a generous size.,5,1

"My dogs are in love with Canidae Maintenance Formula for All Life Stages, and so am I.  Just look at the ingredient list and it's easy to see why.  You'll find lots of chicken, turkey, lamb, rice, and all sorts of other good stuff.  Unlike a lot of subpar dog foods, there is no corn!  Plus, my dogs love its taste, and it's a great value for the quality of this food.  I'd recommend it to any dog owner.",5,1
"I love Starbucks coffees. Always have. Yet I've been reluctant to try any of their flavored coffees because I'm not a big fan of sweetened coffee and most flavored coffees require sweetening to taste good. This is certainly true of Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla, as well.<br /><br />When the package was first opened I was impressed by both the rich and sweet aroma and the beautiful dark and oily grind which was accented by flecks of ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root. I found it impossible not to put the opened bag under my nose and inhale deeply! This wonderful aroma continued throughout the brewing process.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, medium in strength, with notes of mellow vanilla, an almost indiscernable hint of coconut, and a nutty finish. Like every flavored coffee, however, Starbucks Natural Vanilla requires some sort of sweetener to bring out its best flavors (at least for me). I tried a teaspoon of Stevia along with cream with my first cup. Meh. Added Coffee Mate Vanilla to the second cup, which was much better. But the best combination was achieved for me when I added Coffee Mate's Peppermint Mocha holiday creamer. That was the winning combination for me. This demonstrates that Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is really a dessert coffee. And, as fate would have it, my package arrived in the mail on the day after Thanksgiving, which made each steaming cup the perfect companion to leftover slices of pecan and pumpkin pie!",4,1
"As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!",4,1
"Hazelnut is always a favorite standard flavor in my house.  As we go through a lot of coffee, we purchase our K-Cups in bulk so we're always looking for the best price per K-Cup.

We keep our K-Cups on the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E"">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!",5,1
We fed our youngest all three of the HappyBellies - starting with the Brown Rice then MultiGrain and ended with the Oatmeal which I think was her favorite. I love the DHA & probiotics. And that it is organic - which no one else made. This cereal is great because you add your own liquid - she liked apple juice with it - and we didn't even heat it up. She liked it cold. As she got older I would mash up some bananas it in too.,5,1

"I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......",5,1
"I am allergic to soy. I bought a case of this soup, thinking I could share the case with two friends who are gluten intolerant. WRONG! The description says ""Contains no soy, Contains no GMO's, Contains gluten"", and I simply read it wrong, adding a 'no' in front of the gluten. Looking through the reviews, I'm not the only one who made this mistake. Luckily I can keep the rest of the soup for myself, so it wasn't a total waste. It's not an amazing soup, I don't know that I'd want to eat it by itself, but it's good for what I need it for - a soy-free cream of mushroom soup that I can use in casseroles, etc. For that, it's great!<br /><br />IMPORTANT EDIT: After using this soup for a few months, I started having a reaction to it. The Amy's brand is vegetarian and uses a lot of soy in their foods, and either through cross-contamination or a change of formula, I can no longer eat it (or any of the Amy's soups) without having a bad reaction. If you are very sensitive to soy, be aware!!",2,0
"I used to live in Hawaii and really missed fresh coconut water.  The water from supermarket coconuts are hit and miss.  I have tried Zico, ONE and Vita Coco, and although they are all good, I find Vita to be the best tasting.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little pricey, but it is worth it for something so tasty and healthy.<br /><br />Just one more note, you sometimes see coconut water in cans.  That stuff usually has fillers and added sugar.  Always read the labels before buying because there is a lot of junk out there.",5,1

It is very moist and fresh in the can and the right<br />consistancy and sweetness.<br />I only use prune filling in my palacinta and I will only use Solo brand from now on.<br />It is nice to know where I can order Solo instead of hunting for it in stores when I need it.

"I am absolutely OBSESSED with these k-cups. I don't want to admit to how many of these boxes I've gone through in the past few months. It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to ""drink"" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything ""new"" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!",5,1

I read them all and am on the phase I or the Coconut Diet at this time and very pleased with my weight loss so far and even more pleased with the fact that I do not stay hungry...  that morning omelet that I have with a grapefruit is so filling that I have no interest in the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake or pie out there lol ... amazing for me let me tell ya!! lol.  Although I do eat later in the evening a salad and either fish or chicken and drink lots of water I am satiated and feel great!!

"After acquiring the Log Cabin brand, Pinnacle Foods (which also owns Mrs Butterworths) reformulated Log Cabin.

My 3.5 yr old black & white male also eats it happlily; he won't touch any other canned food I've tried including all other Wellness flavors. They both also eat Royal Canin Light dry food.  There is no ""universal"" food that all cats will eat! I just hope my male doesn't decide ""enough"", then I start another search!",5,1
"This is beautiful black finishing salt.  I have used it several times at family gatherings, and it ALWAYS starts conversation!  Very flavorful without being too salty.  Tastes great on anything.  Only con is that it will make your hands, clothes, and teeth black if you get it on there.  No big deal, though, just blow it off!",5,1
"Nature's Variety is a great food at a fair price!  This food has none of the typical cheap fillers that most store bought dog foods have, like corn, soy, and wheat.  It also has no artificial preservatives, like ethoxyquin, BHA, or BHT.  I also like that you can rotate between proteins with minimal/no digestive upset, since the main formula is the same, aside from the meat source.  Every time I buy a 30lb bag, I change proteins.  They have chicken, beef, lamb, salmon, and venison.<br /><br />I've fed Nature's Variety to two of my four dogs for the past three years- their coats look great, and they have been exceptionally healthy since being on the food.  I highly recommend this food!",5,1
"Its koshering salt, not really ""Kosher"" and it has not been blessed by a<br />Rabbi in a clean room in Haifa or somewhere, this is the salt used in the<br />koshering process to extract the last drops of blood from cured meats.<br /><br />Whats different between Diamond Crystal and Morton's? Well for one thing<br />there are no fillers or caking agents, and Morton's is ground rock salt,<br />much coarser and less willing to dissolve than the fine flakes you find<br />with Diamond Crystal. Also DC is distinct from other kosher salts because<br />of its extraordinary texture that easily crumbles between fingertips, its<br />smooth blendability and its exceptional adherence. Diamond Crystal is pure<br />salt and has no additives.<br /><br />Ask any chef why they use kosher salt and they will tell you it tends to<br />have a clean, natural flavor and sprinkles more evenly than other salts.<br />Also, this DC is half as saline as table salt by volume, while Morton's is<br />2/3 as saline as table salt by volume. That means there is less probability<br />of over-salting. The general usage table looks like this: 2 parts table salt<br />= 3 parts Morton kosher = 4 parts Diamond Crystal kosher.<br /><br />Anyway, if you go to diamondcrystalsalt(dot)com under the Culinary tab you will<br />find the store locator for your area. Also on the website is a highly entertaining<br />and informative ""Salt 101"" by Food Network's Alton Brown that will explain to you<br />why you should be using Diamond Crystal Kosher, and how. Never understood why<br />DC is generally found in the kosher foods section of the grocery stores, while the<br />Morton salt is in the spice aisle?<br /><br />This DC product was also awarded the American Culinary Federation Seal of Approval,<br />which basically means this is the #1 choice of gourmets everywhere. Great stuff!<br /><br />And despite any silly claims in the comments section, there is no such thing as<br />""Kosher"" salt, its ridiculous. Sorry. LOL",5,1
"I make the bread following the Sweet Bread recipe, and my kids beg for it. They are both GFCF, so I used rice milk and ghee. It is dense, and moist, and truly delicious. I now make two loafs a week, so there is enough for all of us.",5,1

"I was very excited about this product, then I recieved it! It tastes like metalic/ plastic. It's a weird taste very hard to describe. It smells just as bad as it tastes. I'm upset and amazon said No Returns! I have contacted the manufacturer and am waiting to hear back. I hope I didn't just throw money in the garbage which is exactly where this product is going if they don't take it back.",1,0
Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf is awesome. I have found very few decaf K-cups to even try. I've tried Timothy's Colombian Decaf and Green Mountain Decaf & French Roast Decaf. Emeril's beats them all. It has a nice strong flavor; but no bitterness. Very enjoyable cup of coffee for after dinner for those sensitive to caffeine at night. I highly recommend it if you're a decaf drinker.,5,1
"I was rather dissapointed with this product. I've had Lavazza before and remember it being more flavorful. This was very mild. It may be because it was old stock. The ""Best If Used by"" date on the bag was 7 months ago. I won't order it again through Amazon for fear that somebody it just getting rid of their old stock through mail order. I'll find a more reputable store.",1,0

"Well first off let me start out by saying I enjoy food. Nothing touches my stomach but wonderful deliciously tasty products. So naturally I had to try out Kirkland Almonds.  I will never look back.  Not only did my skin clear up, but my wife had to start arming herself to fend off the women that flocked in my direction.<br /><br />I would never eat another brand's almonds ever again, once you go Kikland you never go back.<br /><br />PROs: Deliciously tasty, brown, age defying after effects. (Even better than pro-active)<br />CONs: The bag is kind of hard to open under its intensely tight glue seal. Kirkland does everything right.",5,1

"Sent for Mom's birthday (she turned 81), thought this would be nice to send to her.  Mom loved the basket, it arrived a day earlier than what Amazon said it would!  She loved the snacks,complained about the weight she was going to gain, so I took that as a good sign.  It was a perfect order. She is picky, so I consider this a home run!",5,1
"I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.",1,0
"For years, I could only find the chocolate flavor at one grocery store.  Then I panicked when I discovered that this store no longer stocks it.  My reaction was to ""Google"" it and, lo and behold, Amazon to the rescue!  This is a quality chocolate malted-milk mix.  It tastes wonderful not only in milk but in non-dairy milk as well, such as soy and rice, so even those who are lactose-intolerant can indulge in this treat!",5,1
"Green Mountain Hot Chocolate is spot on--perfect flavor, popular among kids and grown-ups and highly recommended. One of Keurig's top-notch options!",5,1
"I really enjoy this wine!  I was a little skeptical about it at first because it is so inexpensive, but I tried it at a wine tasting and I got hooked!  It has a wonderful favor and it actually has a taste of red velvet.  This is a great wine for any occasion, but especially for the holidays.  And even though it has the taste of red velvet, its not a sweet wine like a port.  I've also seen this wine available at BevMo, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond and World Market.  Cheers!",5,1
"First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.",5,1
"EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.",2,0
"I bought a jar of this sauce because it was highly rated by the taste testers at Consumer Reports as published in a recent (2011) issue. I was looking for a jar sauce that I could use and enjoy when I didn't have the time to prepare my own sauce recipe.<br />Vincent's is good but not great. I've tried a number of premium sauces and at this point I prefer Michael's of Brooklyn marinara sauce. It can be purchased either on line at their site, at Amazon or at Whole Foods Market where occasionally it's on sale for $5/jar ($10 regularly).",4,1
"I got this set for my husband for part of his Christmas present and he loved it.  He didn't know that Dave's Insanity wasn't the hottest he could get until now - he immediately opened the Ultimate and started ""practicing"" eating it on crackers until it wouldn't make him sweat so he could embarrass his brother by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays.  Next year I'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer, and maybe the nuts too.",5,1
"It's a total cliche and sounds incredibly elitist, but Starbucks' Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee tastes like the grown-up version of nasty flavored coffees from places like Dunkin Donuts and cheap grocery store brands. Maybe it's because I grew up in Seattle and was therefore raised on Starbucks coffee, but I do prefer the more complex flavor of their brews in general and don't find it overly strong or ""burnt"" as many New England natives - raised with the swell on spout at ""Dunks"" - do.<br /><br />Not to be too hard on Dunkin; their coffee is certainly ""budget friendly""! Actually; the 11oz bags of Starbucks aren't very expensive. In fact, you can get it for the same price, which seems a bit odd to me unless the company plans to raise the price to more traditional ""Starbucks prices"" after getting people hooked- which seems like a bad idea.<br /><br />As for the coffee, it comes ground, which is great for most people; not if you do cold brew.  The flavor - at least for the vanilla option - was light but it was there; I found myself using one less packet of sweetener than I normally do. The scent is also not overbearing, but pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it. It's good, it tastes better than the competition, and it's available for (essentially) the same price.",4,1
"I purchased Mini Moos because my creamers were always expiring before I could finish them...I ordered these and keep them both at home and in my desk at the office. They are so convenient -- and this way, I never have to be without coffee creamer. It's awesome!",5,1

"Tasty and healthy milk in great packaging, easy to carry and worth the money. I alternate between chocolate and strawberry flavors.",5,1
So I purchased this product and wasn't a fan of the review stating no pump included and that it was $13 separately. So I decided to purchase without the pump and to my surprise when I got it in the mail today there was a free pump included! I'm not sure if this was a freak accident by Ghirardelli or they changed there ways. But I'm hoping they heard the complaints of buying the pump for an outrageous amount separately and caved into including it for free.,5,1
"I own a Melitta One-to-One single-serving coffee maker and purchased several flavors of Java Podz in order to have more flavors available than the limited range offered by Melitta.<br /><br />This hazelnut pod produces a full-bodied cup of coffee with a distinctive hazelnut flavor that is, perhaps, a little stronger than the Mellita version.<br /><br />Java Podz are apparently intended for the Senseo coffee maker and other models that use a larger-diameter pod.  I had successfully used Senseo pods in my Melitta in the past by carefully compressing and shaping the pod with my fingers as I place it in the Melitta pod holder.  The Java Podz, however, appear to have a little more ground coffee in each pod than the Senseo, so it takes a little more care to get it to fit completely in the pod holder.  (The Java Podz is about the same weight as a Mellita pod, but is larger in diameter.)  The Java Podz work well in the Melitta most of the time, with only an occasional small leak if I haven't positioned the pod just right.",4,1
"So these bars are made of real things, and most of those things are organic!  Or all, I can't remember.  I don't like over processed food, and so this bar is perfect.  It's DELICIOUS too, of course.",5,1
"its delicious almond flavor, price and size, economy and gives us a good complement to every morning, is a favorite of children since combined with yogurt flavors",5,1
"The label says that is product contains ""a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils"".  Well, there are many different oils listed on the ingredient list for this product but the first one listed (which means it's the largest quantity) is mineral oil which is not even listed in the ""Product Features"" section on this website. Mineral oil is not what most people would consider a ""natural oil"". Mineral oil is a byproduct of the crude oil industry. It is similar to petroleum jelly, but in liquid form. This doesn't necessarily mean it's bad for hair, but I think the product name and product features are deceptive.<br />The ""shea"" that's in the product name is listed AFTER fragrance in the ingredient list. That means there's more fragrance in this product than shea butter!<br />The scent of this product is pleasant. It has no rancid odor. The consistency is what I would expect of a typical hair oil.<br />My piece of advice is to always read the ingredient list BEFORE buying a hair product so you really know what you are getting.",2,0
"This is amazingly convenient to carry and add to a glass of water for how quickly it disolves. It's pretty good, but a little too sweet for me (and perhaps why others say they prefer it made extra strong). It tastes much better to me with a little lemon juice for added tartness, but that's hard to come by except at home.",4,1
These are delicious cookies but I just cancelled my subscription. I hope the price comes back down so I can buy them again. They are the best ginger snaps I have found so far but the price is just too much :-(,4,1
"I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new ""Dark Chocolate"" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).",5,1
"Really love this product for my dog.  High protein content, and my dog loves the flavor.",5,1
"A family favorite.  These are really unique treats.  The wonderful taste of flowers.  The violet and rose are great.  Orange blossom wasn't to my liking.  The company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years.  They are made in a small French town that was featured in a movie called ""Chocolat.""",5,1
"We buy a lot of herbal infusions in our family because I'm a day in, day out coffee drinker and when I'm not drinking coffee I prefer a non-caffeinated drink.<br />My husband loves <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BLQ"">Bigelow Constant Comment Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which I grew up on and he never tried until I suggested it. So when I look for herbal teas for him, I keep that in mind.<br />So an orange/spice tea is a natural choice for him. This is a sweet, very orange-y tea that's nicely spicy. It's fragrant enough to smell even with a head cold and it is a family favorite.<br />Like all Tazo teas, the color is lovely. The scent is orange/cinnamon, the flavor is orange/sweet/spicy. One tea bag works well with up to 14 oz of boiling water.<br />Individually wrapped, I usually keep a bag or two in my purse for when we are some place that offers hot water but no teas that we like.",5,1
It does have locust bean and guar gum in it. It is a 1:2 ratio to make smoothies 1 cup mix to 2 cups ice and water. Tastes very good and natural.,5,1

"For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.",4,1
This is delicious!  It is good on its own or in hot chocolate.  We even used it to make chocolate peppermint martinis!  I love this stuff and cannot wait for the holidays to get more!,5,1
Love this product. Nice fresh spices to add to your cooking or just with Oil to dip your bread in.  Awesome!,5,1

"I likewise have my doubts that I got the right tea even though it says Golden Mango on the box and individual packages.  It does not remotely taste like mango and is somewhat bitter.  I can't identify the taste, but it ties for the worst tea I have ever tasted.  I find it odd since other reviewers have commented on how good it is with a real good mango flavor.  I don't know if I'm willing to try this again.  Others who have tasted it agree with my opinion and are unwilling to drink any more of it.",1,0

They are definitely a big step-up from standard chips ahoy (which I would rate as ""OK"").",4,1

Not sure which American cookie to compare them to, probably a chocolate covered Oreo, but with a chocolate middle.  Lots of chocolate here.  That's actually a downside for me.  Too much chocolate.  A little goes a long way with me, so these are amazing in moderation and with a big glass of milk.",5,1
"As the owner of an older dog with joint arthritis, I have tried a number of supplements to assist her.  She also has digestive issues, and I was a bit concerned about trying a new product.  However, I was very pleasantly satisfied with the results.  This powder is easy to mix into food, and my dog seems to find it quite palatable.  She eagerly licks the remaining powder out of the bottom of the bowl.  It also appears to be very effective in terms of giving my dog relief and increased mobility.

"This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12"" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).",4,1
"This particular kind, 95% Beef & Liver, is the favorite of my 4 cats.  They do like the Chicken & Liver, but not as much.  It's good because it's mostly meat.

"My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).",5,1
"This decaf coffee is outstanding. It tastes every bit as good as my regular Colombia Supremo. The price is competitive with other name brand decaf beans that do not have half the full flavor of Jeremiah's Pick. If you love a full flavor coffee and have to have decaf, this is the one to pick.",5,1
"When I eliminated gluten from my diet a few years ago, I cleaned out my cupboards of anything that contained that menacing little protein.  I bought (and mixed) countless flours and grains trying to find a good substitute for all-purpose flour.  Every flour and blend that I tried produced baked goods that were either tough and rubbery or mealy and crumbly.  No amount of recipe-tweaking produced anything that I could happily feed to guests.  Enter Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix.  Now I can serve fluffy and delicious pancakes, bake awesome quick breads, and create yummy coatings for pan-frying.  It's been a while since I ordered so the packaging may have changed since then, but my bags are printed with nine different recipes, which gave me a good place to start.",5,1
"I'm a big fan of most nuts and especially peanuts, but these are the crunchiest, most flavorful peanuts that I've ever had, and just lightly salted, very light, only a little bit of oil.

"My bull terriers can't get enough of these chews! I have searched high and low for the perfect chew - one that lasts and also one that is safe. I have spent a fortune on chews and the ""stuffed"" hooves are the best, also smoked knee bones are excellent.<br /><br />I have never had the hooves splinter or cause any safety problems.  This may be a potential problem with really large dogs who can really get their jaws around the hoof and crunch it maybe...so far no problems with my bullies.<br /><br />The natural ""stuffing"" is all the dried flesh and bones attached to the hoof that most brands remove, this is the best part for my pooches. They absolutely love getting all the stuff out of the hoof...takes a lot of time and distracts them for hours.<br /><br />Also, all of the other ""chew-hooves"" I have bought have a HORRIBLE death-cow-poo smell which made me want to vomit if my dog was chewing them around me. For some reason, this brand just kind of has a mild, smoked-meat smell. No rotten, nasty smell with these.<br /><br />i would definitely supervise a dog with one of these for the first time, since you never know how they will do with a new chewie.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",5,1

And even this season our local Safeway and Giant food stores were selling 24 count boxes for $3.99 a box and I ate a ton of them. But as soon as Christmas was over, my Chocolate Covered Cherries were gone too!  So nice to know I can find them on AMAZON, even if I do have to pay a little bit more.  And being a dark chocolate fan I thought they would end up being my favorite, but I was wrong...the milk variety are still the best and by far better than Queen Anne which their centers are white and more solid. BELLA'S centers are more clear syrup and not solid which I enjoy better. LOVE this brand and Amazon's great service!",5,1
"I found the beans to be of poor quality.  They were packaged in a plastic zipper-sealed bag, not vacuum sealed as I would have expected.  The pods were completely dried out, stiff and flat, not oily and supple as one expects of gourmet quality beans; I was afraid the beans would snap if bent.  There was no oily residue common in good quality vanilla beans.  Getting the caviar out of the pod is going to be tricky in this condition.  The color on the pods is less consistent than I would prefer.  The fragrance, while markedly vanilla, was diluted, likely due to the pods' overly dry condition.  I would suggest that the poor condition of the beans is likely due to the method they were packaged.  Vacuum sealing the beans would have protected them from drying out much better than a plastic bag with a simple zipper seal, which is far from air tight.  The beans are more of extract quality than of gourmet quality.  I am completely unimpressed.",1,0
"This is one of the quite typical case of misleading descriptions and claims. This so called ""everlasting"" and ""large"" treat did not last for even an hour after I gave it to my dog. It is a dinky little thing. Totally not worth your money.",1,0
"This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there.  It tastes like skinny chocolate milk.  If you are concerned about the level of sugar, though, you should stay away.  It is has 18 grams per serving whereas most plain only has about 12. Although, if you drink it before or after a grueling Bikram practice, I think you deserve a little extra sugar.",4,1
"I like PowerBar gel more than most other brands, mainly because of the viscosity/consistency. Competing brands like Gu are way too thick for eating on a run I think - especially in cold weather. The formulation I think could use improvement - it's a little sugary for me, and my stomach feels a little upset after consuming 3 or more on a long run, but it's not too bad (I don't know of anything better at the moment).<br /><br />The Banana strawberry flavor is one of the best, and has just the right of caffeine (1 shot), if you're looking to consume many during a long run.  Vanilla (no caffeine) and Tangerine (2 shots caffeine) are also among my favorites as well.<br /><br />Product came very quickly; I'm happy with the purchase.",4,1
"I cook with Pappy's Garlic herb seasoning all the time. It adds wonderful flavor to virtually everything, including Tri Tip, Chicken, Seafood, and grilled vegetables!!",5,1
"I received the candy in time for Christmas, but as this was to be a gift I am upset that the candy came smashed in the box. I am waiting to see if the candy is stale as well because there is no use by date on the box. If so this will be getting returned.",2,0
"Out of all of the Crystal Light flavors, Strawberry Orange Banana is my favorite. For some odd reason, I can no longer find this flavor in stores. I live in Southern California and it's only available online. I'm so glad that I can order it through amazon.com and at a discount! It's even less expensive when I order it on a monthly basis. Thanks Amazon!",5,1
"I like these grinder products. Very tasty on grilled veggies and meat. BUT........like the other reviewer, this product arrived damaged...one of the three bottles was shattered and the product was in the bottom of the box all mixed together with the shards of glass...nice.  I give the product 5 stars and the package protection 1 star..that averages to 3 stars, but since it ticks me off that I can't return it...I give it 2 stars. I feel better now.",2,0
my wife loves it. it is the only mg product that she takes willingly and according to her it nullifies all her period troubles.,5,1
"Whenever I have a bottle of Glaceau SmartWater, that's one of the main things people ask me: does this actually work or make a difference? To ultimately tell you'd have to do a batter of tests & such, but for me I'm just judging by the way I feel during & afterwards.<br /><br />Taste-wise, you can't tell that this drink has any electrolytes or anything in it, which is a good thing. Water shouldn't taste like anything other than water (unless you are buying something that is supposed to be flavored). It does taste better than some of the other brands out there such as Dasani, so that's a plus.<br /><br />But does it work? I can't give you a scientific show of proof, but I can tell you that I feel better when I drink it. It just seems to give me energy, something that is a plus when you work 2 jobs & go to college at the same time. I feel more hydrated for a longer period of time.<br /><br />This is something nice that I get on occasion when I need a little boost. It's not going to replace my tapwater at home (I need the fluoridated water), but it is something that I'll buy to take to work.",4,1

"I wish I could say that I loved this.  I really do.  However, all I can taste is PLASTIC.  I have no idea if the coconut water is decent or not because the taste of plastic container is SO overwhelming.<br /><br />It honestly tastes like a bottle of average water that has been left in your vehicle in the 100-degree heat for four days.",2,0
"Specifically they love this flavor.  I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats.",4,1
"We had tacos tonight and I tried out a couple new sauces from Taco Bell.  One of the sauces was the Bold & Creamy Jalapeno sauce.  I liked the sauce on the tacos, but would have liked it better if it were hotter with a stronger Jalapeno taste.  I like really hot and spicy food, so I found this pretty mild.  With that said, it had a good flavor and I liked it.<br /><br />I could see it being used on a variety of foods the same way you would use a ranch dressing.  The main ingredient is soybean oil and 100 of the 110 calories in a 2 Tbsp serving size are from fat, so this is not a diet or light dressing.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked the taste, but would have liked it to have been hotter with more of a Jalapeno kick.  It is fattening, so don't load up on it.  For a light Jalapeno taste on top of your tacos or other dishes, it is a good sauce.",4,1
"The coffee, when made in accordance to the directions, is bold and flavorful.  If you like your coffee to taste like coffee - this is a good blend for you.  Best left unadulturated - so no creamer or sweetener.  The second batch we made, we made it a little weaker than the directions, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well.  It is a premium coffee, and priced that way - but if you appreciate a fine cup of joe this will fit the bill.",4,1
"Our Great Dane puppy loved the first 30lb. bag, no problems whatsoever. The second bag, however, caused extreme projectile diarrhea(no joke), which isn't cool for anyone or thing, especially an inside dog. My wife was pretty ticked(she cleans that stuff up). Our 13 week puppy lost ten pounds and spent time in the vet hospital, just to get her digestive system back on. We will not be buying this anymore. We know for certain that it was the food. After switching to another brand, she would get better, then we'd try again. It would come back immediately. We switched to eagle pack, (red bag). It's the best!",2,0
"We live overseas, I ask my husband to pick up my favotite<br />whole foods when he is on a business trip.  It is a hasel for him.<br />The products are hard to find.

It arrived in perfect condidtion and it<br />was exactly what I asked for.  No surprises.",5,1
"I really like this snack bar. I did not really taste the strawberry but the taste and texture was very good. I use it as a breakfast bar. It is very filling and not sweet, it tastes very like a breakfast bar I used to buy from a weight loss program I belonged to.I have been eating one with a cup of coffee in the morning and I am not hungry for about 4 hours. It feels good to have something tasty and handy in the morning to get you going, no fuss, no muss, no bother. I am sold on the Probar Fruition Superfood Snack Bar.",4,1
"I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.",4,1
"I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals. I'll try brewing it loose leaf in case the taste is coming from the bags, but so far I found this tea disappointing.",1,0
"Caf&eacute; con Leche, Coffee with Milk, a Hispanic favorite consisting of dry whole milk, sugar, and instant coffee is tasty and easy to make. Just add 8 ounces of hot water, 3 scoops Cafe con Leche to your favorite mug and stir. You can add more sugar, if desired.<br /><br />Finding this at local stores is hit or miss, so I usually stock up. It runs about FOUR - FIVE bucks per can. When I found it on Amazon it was cheaper!  I'm so spoiled to have this yummy delight delivered to my front door so I can enjoy a cafe-like beverage at home on the cheap. It's my FAVORITE international type coffee.",5,1
"I was a little leary trying this high-alkaline water but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes like normal tap water to me.  Which begs the question:  Why even make this water so alkaline?  Our bodies are usually within the pH of 7. Unless there's a reason to drink this expensive water, I'd rather stick with normal spring water.<br /><br />This water tastes pure but the price is a bit high for daily use.",4,1
"Buying this item was a real shot in the dark. Mother has high blood pressure and this was an alternative salt product. We are VERY pleased with the way it tastes. It has a little bit stronger taste so don't need to use as much as you do table salt in order to get the same flavor. We bought the three pack, hoping we wouldn't be sorry, and we aren't! Love this product!",5,1

"I fed this flavor to my cat for over two and a half years (as a kitten he ate grain-free Innova), almost exclusively wet food. If he got hungry later I'd give him a tiny sprinkle of Wellness dry (salmon), but twice a day he got this food. He developed urinary crystals TWICE even though the food says it's designed to prevent this problem.<br /><br />I was a big believer in healthy, grain-free, wet food, ""natural"" cat food diets. Even when I was unemployed for a year, my cat continued to eat Wellness while I ate instant noodles. It was fine, I thought I was feeding him the best and pre-emptively striking against any preventable health problems. Well, he got urinary crystals on one occasion; I brought him to the vet, $1,000 later and he seemed fine. The vet cautioned me against returning to the same diet but I somehow thought it would be okay and that the diet wasn't to blame. Well, it was. A few months later he got the same problem. Another $1,000 later and boarding for four days, my vet (whom I've trusted with all my pets, dearly, for many years) told me that (1) the ""natural pet food craze"" was overblown and ridiculous, that he's fed a leading brand of standard grocery store cat food and has had cats live beyond 19 years; (2) the diet was the cause of my cat's troubles, and I had to change it.<br /><br />Well, now he's on prescription food that's even more expensive than the fancy stuff but with seemingly far less high-quality ingredients. But he hasn't had the problem come back, and from what I can tell, he's got the same energy levels and healthy coat as before, just minus the urinary troubles. The stray cats my family and I feed (six others) all get the junky grocery stuff like Friskies, Fancy Feast, and Purina, and they have never needed to go to the hospital. I know diet isn't the only factor but it is certainly the major one. I would rather have my cat eating food that doesn't send him to the hospital with a life-threatening condition, than one that makes me feel good about its ""naturalness."" Mind you, urinary crystals are severely painful and will kill your cat if not treated within hours. This food might work for many owners but I'm not taking the risk again.",1,0

"I watched a video on this product.  I'm trying to buy more American made items to support my country.  For whatever reason, I thought this was made in the US.  I bought all 3 Kyjen Dog Games.  They all work just fine.  On this particular one, the rubber sticky foot that stops the game from sliding around, was stuck to the instruction sheet rather than the game itself.  I was able to gently take it off the paper and it had enough stick left to stay on the game.",4,1

"I particularly love cinnamon flavored cereal. My favorites have been Cinnamon Life and the cinnamon flavored Puffins because of the kick from the cinnamon.  Quaker Oatmeal Squares seems much healthier than Cinnamon Life - it's not as sweet and has much more crunch and fiber.

"I love this chocolate covered torrone, and it even has food values on it so I can break it into five pieces and eat one/fifth as a treat. I keep a food diary for health reasons and it's really a fairly healthy treat.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive for shipping costs.  I did find that during the holidays they had free shipping on it, so I stocked up then.  I like that they send three large bars for the price they charge, that's fair for this delicious candy.",5,1
"My whole family has been vegetarian for 8 years now and we are always searching for mock meat that we can use in recipes. I ordered this and didnt have a lot of hope but I was very surprised when I made it and tasted it. The texture is amazing, the taste is great. The grilled chicken flavor is the best. I can use it in so many dishes and the large amount is amazing meaning I can use as much or as little as I want. This will be the main mock meat for my family. I also bought the beef and made a wonderful Stroganoff!!! I can not say enough wonderful things about this product!",5,1
"I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. DHA from fish oil is fine, but the lady that answered my phone told me that all DHA Gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. Do infants need gelatin at this age?",1,0
"I LOVE this stuff.  I can understand the criticism from other reviewers regarding the ""raw-ness"" (or specifically, lack thereof) of the almonds and that is why I deducted a star - the company is misleading consumers with the labeling.  If you are looking for a truly raw product - this is not what you want to buy.  Maranatha makes a raw almond butter that is tasty.  BUT if you don't care about about whether it is made from raw almonds or not (like me), buy Artisana - the taste of their product is out of this world!",4,1

Having moved to the US in the last two years, I was surprised to find that Heinz Baked Beans were not readily available for purchase in supermarkets without being mixed with frankfurters (yech).

The price on Subscribe & Save is a little high, but at least I can get the product I want",5,1

I just received my order today and I love it! The packaging was done very well. It was almost 100 degrees with the humidity and I didn't get home until 8pm and most of the cartons were still frozen. I don't love the packing peanuts though. The ice cream itself is surprisingly rich and creamy. The flavor was nice...not too strong or sweet. It was so rich I didn't think there would be any way I could eat the whole thing. Well...I did! You definitely don't need to though because it does leave you satisfied. I would completely stock my freezer full if it weren't so expensive. It's hard to justify spending so much on ice cream. Definitely worth it for the occasional treat though. Please sell in NYC shops!!,5,1
"This is one of the most delicious cookies I have every had! The shortbread is indistinguishable in texture and taste from its regular gluten counterpart. The pecans add a nice crunch in the cookie and the chocolate keeps the whole thing from being too dry.<br />My only wish is that the chocolate was not in there in such big chunks, maybe broken down more to a chip size. So that you get more chocolate through out the cookie and less chocolate in one bite. But that's just a matter of preference. As far as taste the chocolate is excellent, moist and high quality.<br />I love the packaging just as much as the taste. The individual packages are just perfect to pop in my purse to have later as light snack.<br />If you have celiacs, or even if you dont, I highly recommend getting this cookie. It makes a delicious treat.<br /><br />Pros: Taste. Handy packages of 2.<br />Cons: Addictive.",5,1
"I like the product. The ones I got straight from the UT were badly melted and stuck together so bad that I couldnt' get them separeted.

I have two cats - one of which will eat dry cat food. (The other has had some teeth issues and simply won't eat anything crunchy.) The one the does eat dry cat food though - who seemingly will eat any dry food wouldn't eat this one and I ended up donating it to a local cat rescue center hoping that it would at least feed some cat somewhere.<br /><br />I need to emphasize that my cat is not a fussy eater by anyone's standard and that she would not consume this says something about the product. So I guess it doesn't matter how healthy it may be if your animal won't consume it.,2,0

"Service was good but unpredictable. I ordered three boxes. The page said there was only one in stock. Then there were no boxes, and they would take three weeks to restock. I ordered from Twinings.com to tide me over. Then there was a box in stock after all. Then the others would ship much sooner than three weeks. This was good, but now I have mucho.<br />I am growing to like the Twinings tea. I like black tea, and organic tea, but I need to enjoy the taste. I am lazy and want tea bags.<br />I like the taste to be full and smooth, in other words, not too bitter. And no thin finish. Taste keeps me away from Newman's Own, and from those silky pyramidal tea bags.<br />I liked Celestial Seasonings organic black tea, but it was discontinued. I liked Topco Full Circle organic English Breakfast, but my local store stopped carrying it. I like 365 organic black tea, but I am a hundred miles from Whole Foods.<br />Twinings is a good replacement for those. Bigelow is too. I use double tea bags for iced tea.",5,1
"While I have had many a mint cookie, these are way up on my list.  Not quite the top, but in the top 5 for sure.  I grew up in Wisconson and my Dad loves these (his favs. for sure), so we had them often.  You could buy them right off the grocery store shelves then, but I live in Nebraska now and couldn't find them anywhere but here.  If you have had them before, these are the real deal, just like what you bought from the stores or the Rippon outlet.  If you haven't had them, you should try them, they are a pattie cookie, so they are a bit different than your run of the mill girl scout cookie (not that GS mints are bad, but there are many better) or the like.  I highly recommend freezing them and eating them cold, it is really the only way a mint cookie should be served, IMHO.",5,1

I had planned to serve this as the perfect cap for a recent dinner party with friends, but it didn't last in my house long enough to make the dinner.

Why all these freak ingredients?<br /><br />I had to try it so I could write a fair review... it tasted like it's ingredients: mysterious chemicals. This was no enhancer, but really a ""water detractor"".<br /><br />Stay away from this Franken-Tea unless you crave bizarre chemicals & dyes.",1,0

I have been carrying tea back to USA from England for more than 30 years until I discovered recently that Amazon carried it for me in the form of PG Tips and at such a great price.

It si just not worth me taking up space in my suitcase anymore even though I regularly travel to the UK - I leave roomm for other things that I either cannot get or still cost too much here... but I will never bring tea over again. Thanks amazon. The 2x240 box is a best buy!,5,1
These tasty little biscuits arrived well packed and on time...the expiry date was 15 weeks from delivery..would have preferred more time given the amount of boxes bought.,4,1
"Good texture and spice.  Nice n salty.  Not ""artisan"" standards but who wants to spend $20 for a stick of pizza topping?!?",4,1
"This Roland Sushi Ginger is my husband's favorite by far. I also think it tastes the best. It has just the right balance of ginger flavor and sweet and sour. We have tried two other brands and have found them wanting. One was waaay too salty. The other just didn't have enough of a ginger taste. We are patiently waiting for Amazon to return this brand to stock. I hope we don't have to wait too much longer. PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back.",5,1
"I buy these all the time.<br /><br />It's GREAT for office food. I heat up a container of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPRNGS"">Annie Chun's Rice Express Sprouted Brown Rice, 6.3-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>, combine it with the contents of the Madras Lentils in a deep microwaveable bowl, give it 2 more minutes in the microwave and I've got a hot tasty filling filling, low fat high fiber meal (filling enough in fact that I often end up eating 1/2 and saving the rest for later). Both of these products require NO refrigeration so they are perfect for keeping around the office, at ~$5.50/meal if you eat it all at once, $2.75 if you split it between two meals.<br /><br />I also eat it at home.<br /><br />From a Weight watchers standpoint, the rice and the lentals add up to 10 points total, but like I said its filling enough for 2 meals.<br /><br />I will say, this is Indian food Lite, as in its processed food, and the spicing is mild. But it's very tasty",5,1
"I am out of this coffee and not happy about that. I forgot to order more! Now, I can say that I enjoy the coffee and don't want to recommend it because of my fear that it  will sell out before I get a chance to reorder.<br />I enjoy the bold flavor of  real coffee and the intense aroma that it has. I do not find the bitter after taste that I have found in other dark roasts. I was a little unsure of ordering the Kona because I had thought that the talk about it was just hype, well it is just darn good coffee. It may or may not appeal to you, but give it a try. It is really good.",5,1
When I bought my Keurig coffee maker I was given a sample pack with it. The only coffee I really liked was the Emerils Big Easy bold. The Coffee People Jet Fuel coffee is every bit as good or maybe even better. It is a rich coffee that will get your morning going. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a rich bold cup of coffee.,5,1
"This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.",4,1
The lowest price I could find for k-cups and still tasted delicious!!! K-cups fit my Kuerig and deliver the same results!  I tried several flavors and everyone is true to taste.  I will order again!!<br />Why pay more for the exact same flavor as the other brands??,5,1
"I am not actually trying to avoid the caffeine in coffee just the tannin (it gives coffee its' color and decaf has a higher amount) and messes my system up.  Cafix is the best substitute I've found since I don't care for a sweet taste.  It might could use a bit more barley but again it is the only substitute I've found that I can use on a consistent basis and enjoy.  Thank  you,  Teresa M. Cawthon",4,1
"These Mama brand Namtok noodles are delicious! This description says Namtok Nur, which is beef, but I was sent Namtok Moo, which is pork. Yes, Moo is pork. Nur is beef. Anyways, that doesn't bother me any, I love namtok moo, too! These come with 3 packets inside. One seasoning packet, one hot pepper packet and one with, I think it was lemony seasoning. Wow, this is very, very HOT! I've never had such a flavorful broth either. I drank some thai tea with it, it helped calm down the heat, slightly. Very good, I recommend this to instant noodle fans.",4,1
"These are a wonderful snack, better than popcorn, and they are not so hard on the teeth like other pork rhinds.",4,1
"All three of my cats love this chicken treat, and one thinks it is the very best thing in the whole world!",5,1
"In my humble opinion, these are oen of the best snack foods available.  A bit salty, but I like that.<br /><br />They are reasonably healthy and tasty and with Amazon's subscription discount, suprisingly affordable.  However, if you are getting two boxes at once, they ship it in this huge box that ALWAYS arrives as tho the shippers played football with it first.  it is probably a function of the large size and very light weight.  I have received three shipments so far and I believe every single one arrived that way and each time I had to discard one of the bags because it has had popped open during shipping.<br /><br />The 4 oz bag, tho a bit small, does help keep me from overindulging.",5,1
"My dogs love these treats and will do tricks for them. My little chihuahua sits pretty for me when she sees me with the treat bag. I like that these treats are natural and doesn't have any artificial ingredients, fillers, and preservatives. When I received the product, I looked all over the bag for the expiration date, but it was scratched/wiped off. I prefer that the ""best by"" date is on the package, so that I know it's fresh.",4,1
"Love the cereal, not the muffins. Not sweet enough for me.<br />Was expecting a much better taste. Will not buy again.",2,0
"Before purchasing this product I was a little hesitant and feared Amy's Light would taste kind of bland and very different than Amy's regular Organic Minestrone. IT DOES NOT. It is very tasty and only slightly less flavorful than the original Amy's. In fact, in some ways it is better without the overpowering salty taste sodium provides.  A nice product, particularly considering this organic soup is low sodium.",5,1
"A sure fire cure for when I have an upset stomach. And definitely helps with my GERD symptoms (acid reflux). It just always makes me feel better, that's the best I can say about it. Try it after a heavy meal.",5,1
I enjoy Starbuck's version w/melon flavor in latte and frapuccino. At home I just blend mine with vanilla soy milk which I think tastes awesome.,5,1
"What a find!  Spicy, delicious, vegan, lowfat, reasonably priced, everything one could wish -- the foil pouch makes this a quick hot lunch, a side salad makes it a complete meal. Love it!!",5,1
"The product is fine, but the prices are cheaper at the Supermarket and other stores-L",4,1
"My son is allergic to wheat and this totally fit the bill for our family.  We all enjoy the taste of it, and the texture is just right as long as you don't overcook it.  (I like nine minutes and then run it under cold water a moment.)  Highly recommend for anyone searching for a gluten- or wheat-free substitute.",5,1
"I was surprised at how well the rinds ""popped,"" and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page.",4,1
This will make a great valentine present!  My husband carries these in his pocket for use as an emergency source of sugar for frequent episodes of low blood sugar.  We have recently been unable to find these in the retail stores in our area.  This candy is offered in a few different size packages.  Wonderful find!,5,1
Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again,5,1
"If you're looking for a delicious cereal that is also good for you - look no further. The cinnamon oat crunch is far better than the Cheerios branch, with a better texture, flavor, and more fiber content. If you enjoy sweeter cereals and cinnamon (think cinnamon toast crunch) this is a healthier alternative that tastes equally as good. I enjoy mine with a healthy dose of Silk soy milk.",5,1
"I ordered this for my workplace thinking it would taste fresh and flavorable since it was organic.  Well, it smelled fresh and flavorable but when I brewed the coffee, the taste was that of someone putting cinnamon in the grounds.  Everyone agreed at my work that this flavored coffee was undesirable.  I just brewed it for the 2nd time since receiving it and everyone is just letting it sit there in the coffee pot",2,0
The instant Ginger Honey Crystals are great. I love them. When I feel like a cold is coming on I have a hot cup and it works wonders and makes me feel better.,5,1
"This product is so great!  I can't praise it more.  I don't think there is an aftertast, althugh some other people in my family have mentioned that it does.  I love that it's so convenient.  I pour it in my coffee and use it for baking.  I love it so much I have a subscription.",5,1
"What a great idea with the cocoa and they would be great except for the sucrolose ""diet"" taste.  Don't think I'll buy again.",2,0
Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!,5,1
Great  company. super fast delivery and fresh great product.  Will shop with them again. thanks,5,1
"These are really great bars.  They're not for everybody, but if you enjoy Mojo bars, or anything similar with nuts and/or seeds.  A bit hard, so if you're looking for something soft, this isn't for you.  Probably something you should try before getting a big package of them.  I have purchased them at Whole Foods before.  You may be able to get singles here as well.",5,1
"My husband amd a friend ordered these to make homemade bratwurst, they were fantastic. easy to use. Definitely exceeded our expectations",5,1
Taste exactly like a Caramel Apple. I love after my day sitting & relaxing & enjoying a cup of this amazing hot drink. But if u want it cold it has how u can make it with directions on box,5,1
"Read the fine print, I apparently did not... ""Includes dark roast, medium roast, decaf""<br />My shipment contained 5 decaf cups.",1,0
"I am delighted to have found such a tasty, filling chili such as this one. Because of the black beans, I thought there might be a different taste than I am use to when it comes to chili, but I found the taste to be wonderful. This is the perfect lunch (or dinner) to take to work, which I do frequently. Be ready to really enjoy this filling meal away from or at home.  I heartily recommend this chili.",5,1
"Having bought into the whole 'Campbells Chicken Noodle' gig since I was a kid, the first time my mom bought me this soup, I ignored it....until one day when I was sick and desperate. Wow! I found it to be a really good soup.<br /><br />The broth is flavorful (but not oily or too rich, either- definitely not watery like certain other canned soups available..), the vegetables are great additions, and the chicken and noodles are very similar to the way my mother used to make them. The noodles were large and firm- unlike some of the soggier canned ones I encountered in my childhood.<br /><br />One thing I really detest is finding pieces of fat in my soup-  the chicken in Progresso's Chicken Noodle Soup is always lean, and the soup has no need to be strained. No fat at all that I could see or taste!<br /><br />It's probably been about 6 years since my mom first bought me this brand of soup- and it's been a consistantly excellent product. Calorically and gastronomically two thumbs up!!",5,1
they came in time my dogs favorite she would eat them 20 times a day if i let her<br />so much easier to buy on line good price too,5,1
"my son loves chocolate milk so I bought him the american version of malt chocolate ovaltine thinking 'at least he'll get some vitamins w/ this'.  but he also gets a LOT of sugar with it.  So, I just made the switch to the european brand b/c it has way less sugar.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a chocolate flavor, but I I started mixing it in w/ his American malt chocolate ovaltine and now he drinks the european one straight without even noticing the flavor difference.  And believe me, there is a huge flavor difference.  My husband is repulsed by this european brand which tastes like brewers yeast and barley, but my son thinks he's getting a special treat!  I personally enjoy the flavor.",5,1
these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.,5,1
"We do not use sugar. This product is a great substitute for the ""real"" thing. Great for snacking when mixed with peanut butter. Super on buttered toast or biscuits. I use it in place of corn syrup to make pecan pie, something we love but would not eat - until now. Also use it with Heinz ""no sugar added"" ketchup (and other ingredients) to make my ""honey barbeque sauce"".  Don't overdue it though because too much at one time can create a ""gas"" problem.",5,1
"I got sent a holly bush instead of a Bonsai tree.Funny part of the receipt for the correct flora was attached inside. Slightly funnier, because it was Christmas morning. Then I saw that the plant was sealed and a paper that said refunds were void if it took it out and watered it. However, another piece of paper said, ""If you don't water this immediately, it will die."" SO, I just took the poor thing out and watered it. Now I have a 23 dollar potted plant of something that grows like weeds outside my window. Gee, thanks.",1,0
This is really good. I am on weight watchers and I can have 2 tablespoons for only 1 point vs 5 points of regular peanut butter. I saw this on Dr. Oz's show and ordered it that day.,5,1
"This product tastes just like regular peanut butter. It is great on protein shakes for an extra boost of protein. I highly recommend this product. It is, however, extremely overpriced on Amazon. Found this for 3.29 at a local store. Good luck!",5,1

"To me, this tea has a great lemony taste.  It is good hot...but I prefer it cold and I try to have a container of it in the fridge almost all the time.  I am a ""lemon nut"" and I really enjoy this tea....sometimes I even add some fresh lemon for an extra zing.",5,1
"This is good!  No, you probably don't want to use the largest setting because it will water it down, but I like this.  It's creamy and sweet and just the thing after a hard day at work.  It's probably not on my diet, though.  :)",4,1
"This is the best wild rice brand I've tasted. It's almost $5/lb. at the grocery store, so the deal here is fantastic. I bought 2 6-packs.",5,1
"I've been making nut milks for several years, but have avoided buying a nut milk bag since you have to go on-line and shipping can cost more than the actual product. So instead, I was using cheesecloth, sieves, and whatever I could improvise.<br /><br />Finally, I stepped out of my comfort zone and purchased a real nut milk bag.  Wow, I'm glad I did, since it makes the process so much simpler, less wasteful, and easy-to-clean.",5,1
"For some reason I expected this coffee to really be bursting with flavor. It was decent coffee, but not much better than I could get at a local super-market. I was hoping for more. This would be a good daily drinker, but that's about as far as I would take it.",2,0
"I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.",4,1
"You deserve this.....it is delicious,you,ll love your new coffee maker when you use this.Buy it Try it You,ll be back for more.",5,1
"Dog likes these, he likes those fu fu meaty ones more but they are too expensive.  As for price, $26 and free shipping isn't so bad.",5,1
Great deal! saved a few bucks over going to the brick and mortar store.  Will definitely check out again! My cats love this stuff.,5,1
"The product marketing for this item is incorrect.  This is really the Shrek branded rollups.  Personally, I don't think it is appropriate for me to serve these to my pre-school children.  Amazon was good and gave me a full refund.",1,0
"The grind is fairly coarse so there is not a lot of extraction, use a little more coffee when you brew and you will be rewarded with a smooth, full, non acidic cup of coffee. I have been a drinker of Peet's and Starbucks for years but found the high acidity upsetting if I drank more than a cup or two. Recently a friend of mine from Germany introduced us to this coffee and we have been sold ever since. If you like a darker roast, and a coffee with a finer grind then get the expresso roast (d'Oro) we use this in our drip coffee maker as well for a different but equally non acidic cup of coffee",4,1
i had to order another 2 42 ounce bags today. the others i purchased at amazon did not last very long unfortunately. they are fresh. they are in a nice quality resealable bag to keep them fresh. they are delicious. watch for the lowest price. i am very happy with the freshness and quality of this product. it looks fresh and it smells fresh. i have ordered the 42 ounce size multiple times so far and i have no complaints.,5,1
I was thinking of what to get my brother for his birthday.  While browsing Amazon's Gift Ideas I saw this Bonsai Tree and thought it might be a good choice for this guy who has everything. My only worry: could this tiny tree be delivered in good condition.<br /><br />When I asked my brother about this gift he said it arrived in perfect condition and had a brilliant green color and looks great -- he really likes it!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for solving a gift-giving problem!,4,1

"Karl Fazer ""Blue"" is quite simply the world's finest milk chocolate bar.

"These crackers are not only healthy and gluten-free, they taste great too!  My daughter likes them, and she's a picky toddler.  I think the price is steep here, but you can find them elsewhere for less.  Great for dips, with cheese slices, or by themselves!",5,1
"Please note that this product's ingredients contain whole wheat flour in addition to the quinoa.  In my opinion, the product listing is not clear about the inclusion of whole wheat.  The product photo is a small size and it is not mentioned in the product description.  Unless you see whole wheat in the ingredients list, you may think you are getting quinoa-only grain pasta (which Ancient Harvest also sells).  This could be a problem for those who are gluten-free.<br /><br />As for the cooking time, the instructions say 6-9 minutes, but as with other Ancient Harvest pasta products, I find that 12 minutes is the proper time for al dente noodles.<br /><br />Other than these quirks, Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas are a great alternative to traditional pasta varieties!",2,0
"Order placed 02/12/12 received product as listed, six boxes 16 tea bags each.<br /><br />The tea bags are packed in a ziplock bag.  The tea bags have plenty of room for the tea leaves to unfurl.  The bags do not have the traditional string,  that doesn't bother me, but it may others.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this tea as loose leaf (not bagged).  The quality of the tea will allow me to open the tea bags, and place the tea in a tin.  This way I will be able to brew a pot of tea, instead of a cup of tea.",5,1
I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough. My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.,4,1

"These oatmeal raisin bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (8g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the raisins and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These ""Eat Think Smile"" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't. They have a gritty texture and taste overly sweet. If you are looking for a great tasting real nutrition bar, then check out the Zone nutrition bars or the Kellog's Fiber Plus bars.<br /><br />If you like gritty cookies with a very hard chocolate taste, very sweet and really nothing nutritious in them, then you might like these bars.<br />If on the other hand you are serious about health and nutrition, then there are a lot of better choices that taste much better.",1,0
"I really like prayer plants and was interested in buying a red one.  I decided to purchase these since I was having trouble finding one locally.  They arrived quickly by priority mail.  The 4 inch pots had tape around the top to keep the soil in place and the box they were in was full of packing peanuts.  Be prepared to repot the plants within the week, 4 inch pots are a bit small.<br /><br />The green plant was much larger than the red one.  The green one was also blooming (they arrived in September.)  After repotting both plants they are both thriving and growing like weeds.  They like light, but not direct sun.  The green one folds its leaves more tightly than the red at night.<br /><br />The only thing that would have improved the purchase experience whould have been if Hirt's Gardens had included a care sheet for the plants.",5,1

Aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can, these San Marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the Campania region of Italy. That means they aren't cooked until you cook them, and what a difference THAT makes, especially with sauces simmered all day in a slow cooker or thrown together on the spur of the moment in a pressure cooker.<br /><br />Amazon.com's Free Super Saver shipping makes them a bargain compared to ordinary canned tomatoes and a steal versus the price of San Marzano tomatoes from the store.",5,1

"My kitties love chacing bubbles, and it's great exercise for them. But even though standard bubbles are labeled non-toxic, it bothered me that they were essentially ingesting soap. I really didn't know what it would do to their sensitive stomachs. So I was happy to find these which are created especailly for animals, and therefore safe to be licked up.

Great for your dogs teeth! I an a huge fan of this kind of rawhide as it is very chewable and crunchy and digests well in your dogs tummy! He is a huge fan of them also. LOVES them! Excellent value as always thru Amazon.,5,1
"After not being able to find this product in large quantity, I found it at Amazon.com.  Truthfully, I much prefer these over what you find in the stores.  The taste is sweeter and I needed to use less of the packets.  Would I recommend this - you betcha!",5,1
"It is hard to describe what these bars actually are.  First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet.  TA DA!  Enter the KIND BAR company.  These work as  candy bars.  YUMMY.  These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals.  These definitely are nutrition bars.  Packed with good natural ingredients, these bars are great to keep in your desk or pop into your purse for any emergency hunger attacks.",5,1

The fat free sour crean and onion chips (14 per serving) are great for my husband on his fat free diet.  What I don't understand is why I can bu 14 tubes at one of 2 grocery stores for a total of $ 34.86 bit the seller here want's twice that? I was hoping for a better deal buying a quatity at Amazon.,5,1
"I love this flavor of Kind bars. They taste sinful, but are delicious. I would definitely buy this flavor again.",5,1
"I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I"">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I"">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0"">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6"">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC"">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.",2,0

"I bought this coffee for my sister who has acid reflux disease.  She has been buying it at a local grocery for a much higher price, and was thrilled to get it at this very good price.

"My girlfriend and I got a Keurig a couple years ago. Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig.",5,1

"I had never heard of Sencho shot until I ran across these at my health food store.  I decided that this may could replace my daily addiction to an energy drink, LIMU Blue Frog, so I ordered a case from Amazon.  Sometimes one is perfect and other times I drink 2, but the best thing is the cost!  I was paying 3.50 per can for my Blue Frog and these are only .96 per can (free Amazon Prime shipping) which is a<br />good reason to drink in lieu of my other healthy fav.  Taste is smooth and these are endorsed by Dr. Weil, so I will continue to use.  I am wondering why they are made in China and would prefer that we had these here in the US, but will keep drinking anyway.",4,1

"I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa.",2,0
"Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?)

"This product claims to be Natural.  But there is nothing natural about paying a rabbi to bless a jar of peanut butter. Skippy Natural is a kosher certified product, which means that the consumer is paying slightly extra to cover the rabbinical fees involved in the certification procedure.<br /><br />Not all people want kosher products. Skippy should sell a non-kosher version of this product, for a reduced fee. But they don't.<br /><br />For those who don't know:<br />In order to determine if a product has been certified kosher, just look at the product label.  If you see the letter U with a circle around it, or the letter K with a circle around it (usually it is located somewhere near the product logo), then the product has been certified kosher.<br />You might be surprised to realize how many products in your cupboards have been certified kosher.  When I first learned about this kosher tax/scam, I ran to my cupboards and began looking at labels.  I found that nearly half of the products in my cupboards had been certified kosher.<br /><br />The flavor of this product is good.  But peanut butter always tastes good.  Skippy doesn't deserve credit for the fact that peanut butter tastes good.",2,0

"This is one of the top makers in the world.  They also have premium herbs.  You see the white crocks in Williams-Sonoma and here at Amazon.  They make some of the best mustards in the world as well.  The problem is the import cost.  For the delivered price of this one SMALL ceramic cup, serving two people at most, I buy a half a case in Paris. The ceramic cups are nice and reusable.<br /><br />This is also their ""everyday"" mix.  Fine stuff without a doubt, but it is not their signature recette.  If cost matters to you, get a good double boiler, top grade melting chocolate and whatever flavorings.  I have to give all five stars for flavor, ease of use and for quality, but the price will drive most of us off. BUT...It is easy to reach for and will impress for a special occasion!",5,1

I use this in a mix with Halo and so far we haven't seen any sign of allergies (which is why we changed to Halo in the first place). If you feed your pets the store brand or mass market crud you're missing out on a crucial, easy way to maintain a healthy pet.",5,1

"Man, if you have never drank Kona coffee, and you have a senseo or a similar coffee pod machine, you must try these!  Sure, they are as expensive as it gets as far as coffee is concerned, but, if you really want a unique experience, and you really love coffee, you will be surprised at the subtleties of true Kona coffee.  You don't have to be a conisseur of coffee to appreciate the flavor, just a lover of the stuff.  The light roast much subtler than the dark roast, and much more enjoyable to the less than hardcore coffee nut, which makes these particular pods a great try for folks new to the Kona coffee market.  I have no idea why coffees from different regions taste so much different, and I really don't even care!  All I know is that coffee from Hawaii, especially Kona coffee, it is the best I have tasted so far, and I even think it is worth the huge amounts of cash it costs to drink it...<br /><br />If the cost is too much, or you don't love coffee, then leave this stuff alone.  Otherwise, you are in for a treat!",5,1
"The taste and creaminess is slightly different from the real thing.. I mix it with about twice as much water as the jar calls for. I like it best on crackers, smoothies or other recipes so it certainly fits the bill in my opinion. My 2 yr old is none the wiser so for that reason alone I'd continue buying it. One of the negative reviews sited an 'aftertaste' as a reason it's bad, but all PB's have that. Drink some water if that bothers you.;) All in all bell plantation knocked it out of the park compared to other PB substitutes. LOVE the fact that I don't have to trade hours at the gym for getting my PB fix anymore!!",4,1
"What is wrong with me?  I ~love~ Product 19!  Not because it is healthy (for cold cereal), but because it tastes great and keeps its crunch.  How can Special K, which turns to mush on contact with milk, be so much more popular?  How can it be that even some ""fans"" in these reviews take shots at the taste of Product 19?  My love for this cereal may be slightly eccentric, but I do not rave about it from the perspective of especially favoring aggressively ""natural"" foods that are full of bran or whatever.  True, I hate Wonder Bread and other foods that have been processed beyond all recognition.  But I definitely do not favor twigs and berries.  It seems to me that half the world is willing to give up brownies in favor of granola bars (I definitely am not), and yet people bash this great-tasting cereal as though it were cod liver oil.  But I cry out to you from the wilderness!  Give this stuff a try!  It's delicious.<br /><br />8/22/09 - Gosh...we seem almost like a cult, we fans of P19.  I remember when it was introduced and believe its low sales were caused by marketing ineptness.  It was perceived by the public to be a health food, similar to Special K, which was already well established.  Kellogg's never did get around to promoting it for its great, hearty flavor and ability to stay crisp in milk.",5,1

"I saw the name ""Chips Ahoy!"" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy.",2,0

"My lil' Amy was a rescue kitten found abandon on the side of the road.  She looked pitiful and sickly when I got her since her hair was thin and patchy.  I couldn't help but fall in love with the poor thing, and trying to nurse her back to health.  Unfortuantely, she had constant diarrhea and I ended up trying several brands of kitten food before finally setting on Purina ONE's sensitive formula for kittens.  She blossomed beautifully with the stuff- growing a thick fur coat and had no more litter problems.  After she grew out of the kitten stage, and since money was tight, I put her on Whiskas.  While she loved it and looked fine, I wasn't monitoring her food and she grew really fat and lazy.  When I gave her less, she would constantly meow at her empty bowl.<br />  I bought Purina ONE's weight/hairball formula and gave her the amount of food she wanted to eat.  Even with a minimal decrease in food intake, she started losing weight within a few weeks, and is finally  down to a normal weight a few months later.  She seems to be a more active as well.  I rarely hear any hairball-hacking, even though she spends most of the day grooming herself.  Best of all, my fellow cat-owning friends have asked what brand of food and shampoo I use since her fur is super shiny and very silky.  It is well worth the few extra dollars a month for food since I ended up with a healthier cat.",5,1

"All of America is kraving chocolate and Kellogg's, General Mills and other manufacturers of cereal are capitalizing on it.  Personally, I love chocolate; it is one of my four basic food groups: Fruits, Vegetables, Alcohol and Chocolate.  My favorite chocolate cereal WAS Kellogg's Cocoa Puffs [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E"">Cocoa Puffs, 11.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>] [occasionally, I also eat Cocoa Krispies(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EEE2"">Cocoa Krispies Cereal, 16.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>)].  Now, it is definitely Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal.  See the photographs that I have posted on Amazon's website.<br /><br />  Krave Double Chocolate has a rich, chocolate taste that is not too sweet.  It has a chocolate, wheat exterior that is crunchy and a creamy chocolate pudding-like filling.  I gobble it up before it has a chance to get soggy in whatever I pour on it, usually skim milk.  It tastes especially delicious in vanilla soy milk and vanilla almond milk.  I mixed some leftover Cocoa Puffs with my Krave Double Chocolate and it was great.  I love eating the cereal and drinking the chocolate milk that remains in the bowl.  I'm nearly fifty years old and chocolate cereal always makes me feel like a kid again.  I also enjoyed mixing the Krave Double Chocolate with the Krave Chocolate, which has a plain, wheat exterior with a creamy, chocolate pudding-like filling.<br /><br />  My elderly parents are coming to visit me in a few weeks and I plan to buy more boxes of the Krave Chocolate and Krave Double Chocolate cereals; not only do they taste great, but they are also healthier than other cereals.  Because I suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), I was glad to read that these cereals are high in fiber.  There are three grams of fiber per serving.  Every morning I eat one serving of cereal and two servings of Dannon Activia Yogurt.  Thanks to this delicious, high fiber breakfast, I am able to control my IBS without having to resort to medications that have undesirable side effects.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos",5,1
"Used Cavendars for many years and then for a couple years could not find it in the stores.  My son ran across it at Bi-Lo - SC and picked me up 3 cans.  It is the best BEST seasoning unless you want to pay $100 plus for seasoning.  Works on everything, anything.  Egg and cheese sandwich, tuna salad, steaks (OOH), chicken.

"I ordered this after having a facial where they used a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil and tamanu oil. My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself!  She recommended just getting coconut oil.  I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body.  It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better.

"I felt that I might have a problem with things containing Aspartame, so I decided to look for a gum that didn't have it. This gum is aspartame free, and so far hasn't caused any adverse effects. Gum with aspartame would give me a headache (and no, not from the chewing). I also switched diet sodas, and now only drink Diet Rite or Diet Coke with splenda. I never realized that my little headaches were cause by anything. I guess I thought the chewing of the gum and the caffeine from the sodas caused them, plus they weren't terrible headaches. But now I am headache free! Such an easy little change improved my quality of life. I would recommend this gum to anyone! It tastes really good, and all my friends that have tried it, like it. The only downside is it can get tough, but I don't mind. I only chew it to freshen my breath. I don't think it's a good gum for exercise.",5,1

I pump at work, and I easily get five ounces from each session now that I take Fenugreek.  I take three of them, three times a day with each meal.

The service was great and the product was exactly what I wanted.  I will order this product again.,5,1
"good price and very easy to use, just heat up your popper for 3-5 minutes then cut the top open and pour it in, a few minutes later....movie theater quality popcorn for .50 cents a pouch.  wish i had a larger popper, but this is a great product if you have a 2.5 oz popper.  it is coconut oil (the same kind that movie theaters use, so you get the same taste, fyi they use it because of the high burn temp, so it does not get that burnt taste when cooking)in case you are wondering, since the description does not state the type of oil included and the salt and popcorn are premixed. will buy more.  very fast delivery.",5,1
"I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for ""the time of the month"" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!",5,1
"These crackers are good with so many things - hard or soft cheese, peanut butter etc. and they are great alone. More of a buscuit really than other crackers. They are not greasy and they don't have that whole wheat - whole cardboard feel either.",5,1
I have tried several raw cacao powders from different companies and this one was the worst. When mixed with moisture it becomes like mud. It was impossible to get a smooth dessert or cream using this powder and the flavor seems muted as though the intense chocolate flavor is missing. It was also more expensive than the other brands I tried. I won't order this product again. Very disappointed.,1,0
"This toast is great with hummus and all kinds of dips. Very crispy and low fat. Great crunched up in Salads. Great for h'deovers (can't spell)!<br /><br />What I love about this is that sometimes you buy these things and they taste like cardboard. Wasa (swedish brand) is a good example of this. The only complaint, is that this is not 100% whole wheat. First ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour and then followed by Organic Whole Wheat Flour (I buy the Organic version of the Devonsheer Wheat Toast in my local supermarket). If you're looking for fiber, it's minimal, but it's still great!",4,1
"This is fantastic just as their chocolate powder. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon,a big one) with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. I am really glad I came across of it looking for a fat free calorie free, low calorie search. It tastes spot on like peanut butter. I used it first with Yonanas mixer (and chocolate one too) and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes) One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again. Actually I just had a thought, I think I will put it in recycled Yankee candle jar. That would work.",5,1
The elderflower drink has a very distinctive flavor.  It goes well with gin and lime juice.  Be sure to keep it refrigerated after opening.  There are no preservatives in it.,4,1
"These mango ginger chews are my favorite candy!  They are chewy and sweet, but a tad hot because of the ginger.  I highly recommend them!",5,1
"This is absolutely the best K-Cup holder!  Sits next to the Keurig, on top sits the basket-napkin holder; both the Keurig and the holder are tucked against the wall and the Keurig opens easily under the upper cabinet.  For our home, this provides a much better use of counter space than the flat pod holder.  LOVE IT!",5,1
"I didn't realize before I purchased this that it has sucralose in it. I really dislike the aftertaste, so much that I can't use the rest. If you don't mind that aftertaste, the flavor is otherwise ok.",1,0
"Katy Perry has sung the praises of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LQV2SY"">California Gurls</a>, but not California garlic. Not yet.

"I really like this tea in loose form.  I brew it by the pot, leave the loose tea in the pot and strain out the tea.  It doesn't get bitter if you let it sit too long.  It has a smooth but strong black tea taste.  You can't go wrong with this tea.<br /><br />December 2010:  This is still my favorite tea.  I buy it bulk by the bag from Choice.  It's a great black tea.",5,1
My dog loves these treats & I was happy to find them on Amazon but I'll look elsewhere for them next time due to the fact Amazon's price is almost double that of other sellers,5,1
"I follow the recipie on the bag for eggless version and use the organic bobs red mill flax and water as an egg sub, then I use so delicious unsweetened coconut milk instead of milk. I also bake it in my convection oven 25 degrees lower. I make cup cakes and add 3 trader joes chocolate chips to each cup cake in the middle and frost with a converted butter cream recipe made with spectrum organic shortening and soy free earth balance instead of butter. Don't tell people it's gluten free vegan, they will never guess!  And you would never know there where beans in the ingredients unless you undercook it, so do a toothpic test!",5,1
wish that i could add more stars to this product... this is by far the best moisturizer on the market,5,1

"Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong. Acidity is on a low side, but with plenty of pleasant taste. At the same time you can drink this coffee black w/o the need for the sweetener and/or milk. This coffee is in European tradition and will please many people. I would recommend it after dinner, but not if you need a jolt to wake you up.",5,1
I use these treats for training my Maine Coon.  These are great for training because they are soft enough to break into small pieces and the cat can eat them quickly and await your next command.  You do need to keep them sealed and in the refrigerator after opening and use before the expiration date.,5,1
"I believe that this is the best coconut oil ever made. How it's made sets it apart from all of the others. No smell of burning from the heat of making it, no bad smell at all. Just simply pure raw coconut oil at it's finest.",5,1
"The idea is basically a good one, however, my large Papillon (all 20 lbs of her) could not figure this one out-no matter how hard she tried.  Food is a HUGE motivate her but unless I helped her, eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up.  I will say that the Tug-A-Jug had ME trained!",2,0
I absolutely love Yorkshire tea and am so glad it is now available on Amazon!  A cup of this full-bodied black tea with milk in the morning is how I start each day and just love it!,5,1
I've enjoyed this cereal for as long as I can remember.  When I found it difficult to find I tried other brands and they were terrible imitations. I'm thrilled to find a reliable source for this product on Amazon.,5,1
"This is by far the best Keurig coffee I've had! I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do enjoy a nice bold coffee (9yrs living in Europe will do that). This is the first Keurig coffee to actually give me flashbacks to my time in Europe...bravo Tully's, job well done!",5,1
"I loved these cookies. They have a lot of flavor, are not too sweet and very low in calories and fat.  When you need a little bite of something sweet, these fit the bill.  I would recommend them to everyone!!!!",5,1
"I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste.",5,1
"I've purchased these before individually at the pet store at a much higher cost than buying in bulk here. I'm very happy with the quality of this product - all came individually wrapped in a large cardboard box as pictured. Best of all - no smell (unlike other natural pet treats or chews)! All my dogs, including a picky eater, are enticed by the buffalo (bison) taste.<br /><br />Be advised: this is not a chew product for aggressive chewers unless you are looking to give them a quick snack. Since it is jerky, it doesn't have the hardness of other products intended for longer chewing time. However, it works perfectly for my allergy-prone medium-level chewer as a 10 minute-long treat.",5,1
"I was not happy with these art heart bottoms. Only 2 cans survived the trip, and the product in those tasted heavily of the can, yuck.  I will be looking for art hearts in glass jars...and not ordering them online so they stay intact.",2,0
"Started working after one day for me!  It only took 2 drinks to go from 2.5 oz to 5 oz pumped on each side. I also enjoy the taste. It isn't bitter at all. Especially for me, cause I HATE tea.  I added a spoonful of honey to it and it's YUMMY!",5,1

"Recently I switched my bad eating habits to good ones.  Part of that change was finding a sweentner which would not interfere with blood glucose levels much, and tasted good.  I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be ""wowed.""",4,1
"I have recently fallen in love with Multi grain CRIX (green package).  I know...there is wholewheat too geeeeeeeeeez...NOTHING beats the taste of Multigrain!!  Try it, I'm so sure you WILL like it.

"I would have preferred some dark chocolate with my nutmeg bar.<br /><br />It was unpalatable. I had to hold my nostrils together to get it down. I had 2 other people try it and they didn't like it either.<br /><br />I can see one person here reviewing loves is, which is great, at least someone does. But, I thought it was terrible. If I had a crazy sweet tooth and it was the only chocolate around, I still wouldn't eat it.",1,0

yerba mate arrived ok!  I can't really tell a big difference between the major brands but Union is best I think.,5,1
"I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.",5,1
I prefer mustard sauce . I tried 3 brands of sardines in mustard. These are the best I have had. Recommend highly. I subscribed.,5,1

"I totally love this tea.  It brews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in - very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it, too!  Best with honey pearls also sold by White Lion Tea.  And it's organic!",5,1
"I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion.",1,0
"The reviews for these dried cranberries are glowing, so my response may be a matter of taste.  I found these cranberries to be a little bitter and somewhat oily, instead of having the ""tang"" that cranberries usually have.

Yum! I love this stuff. Gives steak a sweet tangy kick without the carbs. It's not as thick as real BBQ sauce but it tastes just the same to me:),5,1
"It took me a while to review this chocolate because I was torn.  On the one hand, I don't get to eat chocolate this rich, so I wasn't sure that it was even milk chocolate.  On the other hand, it was so rich, deep, and satisfying, that I didn't care.  So I ate another bar just to make sure.  Unfortunately, I'm hooked on this chocolate now and don't know if I can eat a Hershey bar anymore (well, okay, this chocolaholic most likely could be talked into it).  But for sure, I'm hiding the rest of this stash and not sharing with anyone.<br /><br />The taste is extremely rich and refined.  I found the melt factor - always important in my chocolate eating to be higher (must savor it longer to melt it in my mouth) than the milk chocolate you buy on a general basis.  This gives it a lasting taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Worth the extra money and definitely a wonderful product.",5,1

Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.<br /><br />The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found.",5,1
"So yummy. I got bought a box just to try them from the microwave. Great snack with a glass milk. Travels very well, so I keep a bar in my bag. Worth the buy!",5,1

True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers ""Greenie, greenie"" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.  A good testiment for a fantastic product!!",5,1
"I picked up a box of Grove Square ""single cup"" coffee (medium roast) at Wal-Mart. I should have shaken the box and compared it to another brand and maybe I would have caught on before I left the store. At home when I took one of the cups out to put in my Keurig machine I shook the cup and was alarmed at the noise. Regular K-Cups don't make that much of a noise. I brewed one to test it and the coffee was just so-so.<br /><br />After the K-Cup cooled down, I took a knife and removed the foil top. There was nothing there. At all. Just an empty cup. In other K-Cups there is a filter and the coffee grinds are left in the in the filter. Since there was no filter, no coffee grinds left in the cup, and none in my cup of coffee, then the Grove Square ""single cup"" coffee is glorified instant coffee.<br /><br />I was not impressed. They are being returned to Wal-Mart.",1,0

"I purchased these almonds last week because the price was good. When it arrived I opened the box and found it neatly packaged. The almonds are very tasty and fresh, much better than the ones you get in the store. I like the portion sizes too. I eat one bag a day and there are 320 calories per bag. If that is more than you want to eat, I recommended  Madi K's Whole Natural Almonds, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 48)also sold by Amazon.",5,1

I drink this tea two to three times a day minimum. It has worked great for increasing my milk supply. The taste is good (but I sweeten it with 1 tsp of sugar). The 6 pack makes it convenient.

"Searching for a moist, true fudge brownie?  Look no further!  My own personal quest in the search for the ultimate brownie brought me to countless recipes on the internet which I tried, then promptly threw away.  Nothing worse than having a dry cake brownie when you want a decadent, deep rich, moist fudge brownie!  Having spied the Ghirardelli brownie box in the grocery store, I thought why not?  After all Ghirardelli does make chocolate.  By the way, the box says ultimate fudge and for good reason, it's a true statement!  These are so sinful, so delicious that I will never be trying another recipe for homemade.  Forget that when Ghirardelli makes it so easy.  The packet of fudge topping makes it all the more better.  Honestly if you desire a rich, sinful moist fudge brownie, this is it.  Hands down it's the winner and I would rate it at 10 stars if I could.",5,1

I have bought this candy several times at Chinatown in Chicago(I believe). The candy tastes so great and I couldn't stop eating it so I bought another pack to share with some friends. We all loved it! The one downside is there are about 7 or 8 pieces and the pieces can be eaten in one bite  .,5,1
"This is the one Rum Essence I use and I am never dissapointed. It is amazing! Dr. Oetker's Rum Essence smells like childhood to me, like the cakes and cookies my parents use to make.

And everyone who will taste it will wonder what the special ingredient is...Fabulous!!!",5,1

"This bar is billed as 100% premium organic chocolate, actually, dark chocolate 54%.  My passion is dark chocolate.  It's 2.25 ounces totaling 330 calories, and they are absolutely delicious.  Bottom line, however, this bar tastes more like the richest, most creamy, milk chocolate bar you will ever eat versus true dark chocolate.  There is no slight to outright bitter edge characteristic of dark chocolate, yet the bar is not overly sweet.  By rights this bar should lose a star regarding the dark chocolate issue, but it's just too good overall.",5,1
"I just bought one of these flip waffle makers after falling in love with them while staying at a hotel (it had a free breakfast deal in the lobby).  The waffles were incredible and the maker was fun to use.<br />I went on Amazon and bought one of those same waffle makers with ease, but, I had no idea which mix I needed to buy.  I tried a couple and they just didn't seem to either taste quite right or rise the right way.<br />I found this pack (Heartland) and I am glad that I did.  This is the perfect mix.  I have to say, 5lbs. is a lot!  But don't sweat it--if you love Belgian waffles, you will fly through a bag faster than you think.<br /><br />Enjoy:)",5,1
"These are SOOO hard to find at a good price. You can add these to almost any drink, and get the caffeine you'd expect of a cup of coffee. I have not noticed any taste to these, but have never had one plain either. They are not intended to be a shot that you drink alone,  but to be added to a cup of coffee, a smoothie, hot cocoa, chocolate milk, literally any drink. They are the size of a coffee creamer cup. I freeze them and don't worry about the expiration date. They arrive perfect and all intact.",5,1
"I was happy to find these cordials on Amazon. I hadn't had them in years. They are exactly as I remember, good chocolate on the outside of a sugar ball filled with liquid flavor. I bought the raspberry filled. Sometimes artificial raspberry flavor is awful....these were wonderful. Hard to stop eating them which could be a problem since they come in a 5 lb bag. I used to always buy the cognac flavored, excellent also, even though I don't drink cognac or even like it for that matter! I will be ordering more of these yummy balls once I loose the weight from the first 5 lbs. LOL",5,1

"Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!",1,0
"I bought Erin Baker's breakfast cookies for my teenage daughters who are in swim team and leave for practice early in the morning.  This made for a very convenient breakfast for them after their practice and morning workouts!  Paired with milk or a piece of fruit, this was definitely a filling and satisfying breakfast for them.<br /><br />We enjoy the moistness, density and great flavor of fruit and nut.  We have tried other flavors, but this one rates top of the list.  We also feel it's a healthy option for ""on the run"" mornings.<br />GIVE THEM A TRY!!!",5,1

"This is, at $1 a can, the most expensive cat food that I've purchased.  It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given.",5,1
"Although it may seem just a tad precious, our vet recommended this for a young cat who doesn't brush.  He has clean teeth, fresh breath, and I hope will have all his teeth all his life.  Plus, both he and his girl friend love the taste!",5,1
"My 11 yr old terrier lives to walk & play.  Several months ago, she stopped playing and refused to walk except to go out & take care of business.  She seemed to be in pain & could not jump up at all either.  The Vet couldn't say for sure what was wrong with her without taking all kinds of tests, but said she appeared to be having joint pain and was probably developing arthritis.  The salesperson in Pet Nutrition recommenced Happy Hips.  Within 2-3 weeks she was like a puppy again. I ordered several online since Pet Nutrition was out of stock my last visit.  I cut up 1/2 a treat and mix it with her food 2X a day.",5,1
"We adopted a beautiful gray kitten from the local rescue shelter, after a year or so she began to become very lethargic. She lost weight and her coat became very patchy - she was scratching and itching constantly. She also vomited nearly every day.<br /><br />The vet thought perhaps food allergies were the culprit and he recommended another premium food, which helped with her coat, but she continued to lose weight.<br /><br />We are becoming very concerned at this point, and decided to stop into a local specialty pet shop. They recommended Spot's Stew sensitive.<br /><br />The food has most assuredly changed my cat's quality of life. She has gained weight, her coat is shiny, healthy and full, the scratching and itching has ceased. She is full of life again and very playful.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this cat food if your cat has sensitivity issues. It truly has been a life alternating choice for our cat. It has been several months and we are quite pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.",5,1
"I normally do not drink regular coffee. I will enjoy a Cafe Mocha or a drink made with expresso and heavy cream...so it basically doesn't taste like coffee. I bought this because I love caramel flavored drinks. I will agree that the caramel flavor is not as strong as one would think, but if you add a flavored creamer, it tastes wonderful. I used a caramel macchiacto creamer and it was delish. I can't wait to try this with a mocha flavor and maybe some Cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />I never encountered the ""chemical"" taste mentioned above.",4,1
"""You are indeed, a twisted pretzel of a man!"" croaked my lovely, at least in my own eyes anyway, wife Dorothy D. Pretzel. After that it was love at first bite.

In fact, I've added these to my wishlist, along with a few other items you can pick up for if should you so desire. Now if you don't mind, Dorothy's calling for me, she needs pumiced again.

"A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.00, but I picked my Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Graham Goldfish Crackers (Pack Of 8) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com and shipped free to my home for an awesome price of ONLY $10.63!!! If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do! Good Luck and happy bargain shopping, ENJOY!!!",5,1
"I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.",5,1
"My dogs are in love with Canidae Maintenance Formula for All Life Stages, and so am I.  Just look at the ingredient list and it's easy to see why.  You'll find lots of chicken, turkey, lamb, rice, and all sorts of other good stuff.  Unlike a lot of subpar dog foods, there is no corn!  Plus, my dogs love its taste, and it's a great value for the quality of this food.  I'd recommend it to any dog owner.",5,1
This is a great coffee choice for those who like a bold cup of coffee. It is rich in flavor without being over powering. I highly recommend this product!,5,1
"I have to agree with the reviews that comments on the texture as well as the taste.  I also bought 12 and had to throw out 11.  I was really disappointed as the picture looked nothing like the finished product.  The gloppy green paste that was the result had a really questionable taste, too.  I can't recommend this mix to anyone who might be looking for a good alfredo sauce.  Don't waste your money!",1,0
"I love Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha but it seems to sell-out at the stores quicker then they can stock it.  I'm used to buying the 18-Count Packs which is what they sell in the stores and when I ordered these I didn't realize they were 12-Count Packs.  The 18-Count Packs run about $11-$12 per Pack in stores so you're not saving any money here by buying 3 12-Count Packs but on the other hand, they always seem to be out of stock in my local stores so the convenience of being able to order it through Amazon was a plus and delivery was very quick!",4,1

"Ordered and paid for 4 cases of Fever Tree tonic. Received 3 cases. Waiting for a response on the 4th case from Amazon.

"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.",1,0
"We are avid Matcha drinkers in my house. While this Matcha is slightly lower grade of tea than what we usually buy from Malden Teas or other tea vendors, the price is very good. The taste is palatable and can be consumed without other flavorings. Overall, if one is a matcha drinker on a budget, this is a good choice.",4,1
"Love this product. Perfect for babies while on the go. We actually purchased these specifically while on vacation (usually I just have a few on hand for occassional use). My daughter gobbles these up. I just wish they sold a variety pack! I find myself filling with with individual ones of a different flavor here and there cause I can tell my daughter gets tired of it.<br /><br />Although, along with a previous review, I too, received the 3.5 ounce package rather than the size stated in the description. BUT, Amazon has amazing customer service and immediately fixed the problem. And that's the only reason I give it four stars (and the fact that I wish there was a variety).<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying these, totally worth it.",4,1
Hi-Chew makes Laffy Taffy taste like paint thinner.  It has a firm consistency and a true grape taste that lasts from the second you start chewing until the very end.  The Sour Apple flavor is also great.,5,1
"""Hello, my name is David, and I'm a sugar addict."" ""Hello, David."" True, I love my sweets, but my sweets do not love me. Hence, I tend to rely on sugar substitues (perhaps a little too much) to stave off those sugar cravings. My go-to has always been stevia, in one form or another, whether liquid extract, powder, crystalized (Truvia), or organic ground, as I think stevia is an excellent sweetener. But, always willing to try something new, I was happy to indulge in Nectresse, a new natural sweetner from the makers of Splenda.<br /><br />The primary source of sweetener in Nectresse is monk fruit (aka luo han guo), which I have eaten as an additive in other foods, and have always found to be tasty. This was my first opportunity trying it as an actual sugar substitute, so I tried to utilize it in several different applications.<br /><br />First, on its own, Nectresse is great. I initially thought there was a slightly off aftertaste, but I realized it was hints of the monk fruit itself, and the flavor everntually grew on me. I then sprinkled Nectresse on various kinds of fruits, from watermelon and peaches to strawberries and cantaloupe, and it fared well on all of them, adding just the right touch of sweetness without overpowering the natural flavors of the fruits.<br /><br />I also added Nectresse to cold almond milk, as well as hot tea, and was very pleasantly surprised to see how well the granuals disolved in liquid, which tends to be problematic with stevia (mostly so with Truvia). And not a lot of Nectresse was necessary to sweeten the drinks (maybe half a packet), so a little goes a long way.<br /><br />I did not have the opportunity to bake with Nectresse, so I cannot comment on how well it does in baked goods, but based on my initial observations, I think it's likely to perform well.<br /><br />Now, I would exercise some caution here, as there is sugar in Nectresse -- though, less than 1g (which, in a 2.4g serving, could still be significant). The other ingredients are Erythritol and Molasses. So, if you are on a complete no sugar diet, you'd likely have to skip this sweetener. Still, there are 0 calories overall, with the Erythritol providing 2g of carbohydrates.<br /><br />Overall, I think Nectresse is a far better option than Splenda and Aspartame (especially considering their sketchy health and safety issues), but in my opinion, not quite as good as stevia. But, taste is highly subjective, so I think opinions are likely to be quite divided here. I will definitely continue to use Nectresse, as it's a great form of monk fruit extract, but it won't be the first product I reach for when attempting to quell my sweet tooth.",4,1
"Our dog just goes crazy for these.  We call them fingers in our house, but when he gets one he runs and barks, tries to hide it for later then he finally settles in for a quick chew snack.

"I am very, very impressed with this particular seller, Shopping Store.  They sent the Turkey Span amazingly quickly and efficiently.  I received it two days after I placed the order even though I specified Standard shipping.  I plan to purchase other products from Shopping Store in the future.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of turkey.  I will make an extra large turkey at Thanksgiving so I will have plenty of leftover turkey for later.  Turkey Span will be a reasonable substitute the rest of the year.  It will pair well with eggs, make good casseroles and decent sandwiches, just to name a few uses.  It also has a good turkey flavor.",5,1
I purchased a Keurig single cup brewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.

I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.,5,1
"I wanted a lot of bouncy balls to toss around a small office space with tiled floors.  These balls arrived in a HUGE bag, no overwhelming ""gas smell"" that you may have heard in other reviews, and each ball was plenty squishy and provided ample bounciness.  They will be utilized to toss or be bounced into small cans and targets strategically placed throughout the office space.<br />So far, these balls have refracted off of monitors, TVs, bystander's heads and bodies, and have not caused any damage, other than to personal pride.<br />I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a ball that you can launch without repercussions.<br /><br />*Update:<br />The balls have been taken outside and now their main purpose is to land in my neighbor's flower pots, which are across the street, more than 100 feet away.  With proper trajectory, they can land mid-street, then have 1 sidewalk bounce, and then pound my neighbor's door.<br /><br />Pros- High quality (they've been run over by cars & survived)<br />  - More than ample bounciness<br />  - Wide variety of bouncy balls (some tie-dyed, some soccer balls, some pool balls etc)<br /><br />Cons- A very select few seem to be made of a different material (mostly white with random colors).  Those ones will become hard and brittle if left in the sun for a few days.  Will still bounce, but seem to lose a bit of elasticity.  Very few of these balls have been shipped to me.",5,1

"These may not work as an effective ""appetite suppressant"" for me, BUT, they seriously take between 45 minutes to 1 hour to finish!!!  That is great for me because they keep my mouth busy and I'm not thinking of snacking all day.  Also, by the time I finish one, I have to wait to eat anyways just because the sweet taste is still in my mouth and therefore keeps me satisfied for another 30min to an hour later =)  Well, then maybe they are an appetite suppressant. LOL  I ordered the assorted flavors pack because I wasn't sure what I was in for.  Initially, I thought I wanted to order just watermelon.  Glad I didn't, it was nasty!  My favorite flavors ended up sup rising me: cappuccino, candy cane, root beer float (I normally HATE root beer anything).  I also love the cherry (taste like Luden's cough drops) and the grape.

"But that first cup is made before my last remaining braincell becomes functional... kind of robot control.  And when I dump either the refrigerated creamer or shake the powdered creamer into my cup, it's hard to control how much goes in.  Often it's way too much.  I'm never smart enough to measure with my spoon.<br /><br />So these little pre-measured containers work a little better for me.  Only problem is, I use a 16-oz cup, so one is not quite enough and two make a bit of an overdose, so I've settled for one.  This huge box of them should last a long time at that rate.  They're just as delicious as the refrigerated coffee mate, and a little better than the powdered, which to me tastes... powdered.  I like them fine and per ounce, I got them at a better price than either the liquid or the powder.  We'll see how long they last.<br /><br />From Utopia, Texas... Enjoy your java!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I had to go away for a couple of months and when I returned, these didn't taste the same... chemical taste and not very enjoyable.  I tossed them.  I'd reduce the rating by a star or two if I could.",4,1
"I cannot recommend buying this product.  I think the manufacturer is fobbing off its dented cans on Amazon customers!  Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this.  I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.  Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them.",2,0

I was astounded and extremely pleased with the shipping speed from this seller.  I ordered mid-day Thursday (and marked ""Super Saver Shipping"" as they instruct for expedited shipping) and received the product on mid-day Friday (21 hours later!) even though Amazon had quoted an expected delivery the following Tuesday.  Signature was not required for delivery, which is good for people without that flexibility.  There was a very small amount of dry ice left in the package, and all contents were cold.  Considering free overnight shipping, the price for this is really low.  Great value for a product that is almost impossible to find/replicate (near restaurant- quality frozen Tikka Masala).",5,1
"After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean ""look"" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again.",2,0

They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to ""pop"" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a ""use by"" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.",4,1

The product arrived in great condition. As I set the can on the table my 4 month old was going nuts over the can! He head butts the can and although it has only been a few day I am positive he knows what the can looks like and that it is kept in the fridge. His older counter part doesn't go AS crazy but she loves it to! She like to try to eat it and roll around in it. Overall I am happy the cats LOVE this stuff it really does seem to be the best.

"I love these cinnamon candies.  They are not the same as the cinnamon disks or imperials.  Much better!  I am having trouble finding them.  Was able to get the 2# bag at Wal-Mart but the last two times I have been there, they have not had any.",5,1
"This makes a excellent cup of iced coffee or frappuccino... (the hot coffee is ok too). Milk is already an ingredient, so just add water if you're watching carbs.  Also try one scoop Click and one scoop of your regular vanilla protein mix in the drink or frappuccino if you want a lighter taste and less carbs.<br /><br />I've used it in the morning when I don't have time to brew coffee (or eat) and have to run out the door. It's actually a good post- exercise recovery with the carbs and protein if you want to switch your mixes up.  Plus to me it's kind of like a guiltless pleasure for those days you just don't feel like downing a protein drink.<br /><br />At my house a McDonald's Frappe/Starbucks Frappuccino drinker and the kids both love it!",5,1
"Soft, and oh, so delicious! I'd about had it with packaged cookies until I tried these! You won't be disappointed!!",5,1
"I ordered these along with some of the sour bears to try from this Albanese brand.  I received a box of melted candy that was unrecognizable. It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little.",1,0
"This was my first time ordering something from the Vine that I could not really review myself.  And our dog, Lucky, can't speak...English.  I do, however, understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says ""Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT",5,1
I ordered this coffee because we were having guests for a week from out of town.  I knew they liked French Roast coffee.  Well it was a total success.  Great coffee and conversations.  Thanks.,4,1
i surly bought it for the sake of a good sprayer but this is a spitter when you press it slow... it spit a strong shot of oil just like a water gun. but when u press it fast and hard it spread little bit good. the best thing in it that it is a glass.<br /><br />i give oil - 1-5<br />spitter  2-5<br />glass 4-5,2,0
"Okay, I love my orange fingers, but if I can buy something healthier and just as good tasting THIS IS IT.<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the absence of orange fingers. Oh wait, I just did. Taste just as good. Just as satisfying, and a bit cheaper... Hard to believe but with Free shipping you can't go wrong. These sell for a fortune at the grocery store.",5,1
My dog wouldn't eat these and neither would my daughter's two dogs.  I don't know what it is about the flavor but they didn't like them.,4,1
"Plain and simple, this is the BEST apple juice that you will ever drink. It is not the cheapest juice out there but it is well worth it. It would be a good thing to give as a special treat to some kids (or adults). I keep it in the fridge. I PROMISE that you will go gaga over this.",5,1
"Our dogs love them, but they seem a little tougher to chew than the ones with the apple wrapped inside.<br />We decided to give them a try, because our girls really love bananas. Would purchase again and recommend!<br />Love the large bag also!",5,1
I have tried other chocolate covered fortune cookies and Emily's is by far the best.  This chocolate with a hint of orange is very good.  You need to sit and enjoy not gobble is down.  It tastes so good.  Enjoy !!!,5,1
"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG",5,1
I've purchased several different brands of liver treats and this is the best in terms of having good-size pieces with very few small bits and little powder.,5,1
"If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a ""super bar"" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.",5,1
"This is a really, really good instant oatmeal. I have a soft spot for apple cinnamon instant oatmeals and have, in the past, eaten Quaker's and McCann's versions. This one is by far the best. The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).<br /><br />The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3-5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice ""gloopy"" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir--it will be ""pebbly"" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.<br /><br />The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and ""clean"", and I tend to sweeten it just  a bit more. I also tend to use two packets, but then, I used to use two packets of Quaker, etc, as well.<br /><br />Another good product from Dr. M. Hurrah!",5,1
It is a 5 stars! The package is nice and fair price. My cats Walle and Eva loved it! I will get this one for my cat next food supply!,5,1
"One of the best shakes ever. If you're looking to break the frappacino habit for something a bit healthier...and cheaper...this is it. 2 scoops, 8 ounces of soy milk and a cup of ice in the blender is now my standard coffee break.",5,1
"I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.  It's smooth, uniform, and though delicate the peach flavor was definitely at the forefront.  I don't know if the pot I tried had been sweetened or not, but I was floored.  It's easily the best tasting tea I've ever tried (though admittedly that isn't saying much; I'm not a frequent tea drinker).<br /><br />The economic part comes in with the multiple infusions.  This isn't a makes-one-pot product; you can refill the pot and brew again with the same blossom and get multiple pots out of each 'ball.'",5,1
i enjoy and use this product on a daily basis so it is always on my shopping list.<br />the right size and fresh product makes this purchase a good deal.,5,1
Just stumbled upon this drink.  I really like it. Not so sweet or grainy as many other protein drinks.  However you do need to remember to shake it up before you drink it.,5,1
"I tested the pH of this water. I am very disappointed because it's far from the generous promise. The pH barely reaches 8 and is not any different from the spring water I receive from a water delivery service.<br /><br />Don't be fooled. Promise is not kept. Or, well, you may try for yourself. pH testing strops are easy to get. Let me know your result, I am curious.",1,0
"I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol",5,1
"For Lapsang Souchong, Twinings' version really isn't that good. The smokey essence is very artificial smelling. There are no ingredients listed on the box or any indication as to what they have used, but it smells like ""artificial smoke flavor"". VERY pungent odor before even opening the box, almost intolerable when steeping. Should be a softer smoke. Not as strong on the tongue but artificial smoke scent was unbearable. Sorry Twinings. I'd say spend a few bucks more and get a looseleaf variety instead. It'll be a much more ""real"" Lapsang Souchong experience.",2,0
"My cats love this food, I was buying the more expensive cat food, and heard about this product and all of the excellent ingredients it has with no by-products all natural, so I thought I would try it.<br />The price is very resonable, and my cats love it, it's a no brainer. Thank you Chicken soup you made me and my cats very happy.",5,1
"If you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!<br /><br />Having the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.<br /><br />This really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!",5,1
This mix was terrible; the consistency of glue and did not taste good at all!  I will not purchase this again.,1,0
This tea is wonderful - flavorful w/o being too harsh.  Makes great cold-brew ice tea (sun tea).,5,1
"These Mega Smarties are good, but they are not the same as the little ones.  These are more sweet tart like.  I enjoy keeping a pack at my desk.  They were also a hit for Halloween!",5,1
"These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as ""Original""... and lo and behold, I received ""Sea Salt and Vinegar"", not ""Original"".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of ""Original"". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).",4,1
"I bought this decaf coffee for my wife and she was surpised at the flavor (it actually had great flavor). I tried it and it was very good. Clean and crisp, and enough coffee in there, that you can brew a large cup (press the small cup selection, let it brew, then press the small cup selection again) and it is still very good coffee. In fact, I'm going to go brew some now for myself :)<br /><br />I bought this from Amazon and have always been very happy with their shipping, packing, etc. This order was no different! Thank you!!",5,1
"If you like a strong cup of coffee, this is it. Some K-cups are kinda weak,( I like mine on the strong side). I don't like french roast or some other types of extra bold if they are gonna have that burnt taste. But this does not. It's just a strong type of coffee. If your like me, you will like it.",4,1
"For a tiny little container, MIO includes quite a bang for the buck! The most important factor, of course, is taste and everyone in my family loves this flavor. We can add it to tea or lemonade or simply enjoy it in a chilled glass of water. In winter, it is the perfect addition to yogurt or oatmeal, adding variety to these basic products.<br /><br />Soft drinks can take up space and the packages can be difficult to lug but even those with limited space can find room for a MIO container. We have a small desk organizer with several MIO containers neatly arranged in a row. The organizer takes up about 6 inches or less, front to back, in a cabinet, and even less width-wise. Compare that to the space required by soft drinks.<br /><br />If you like to have something on hand to add to water while working, this is convenient to keep in a desk drawer and eliminates the noise of a pop can being opened in a shared office space.",5,1
My family loves smart puffs. They are a healthy alternative to cheez doodles. We have ordered several cases from Amazon. The price is right!,5,1
I read all the other reviews...I'm in the camp of the customers who think it tastes pretty terrible. Two days into a 3 lb. bag; not sure if I'm going to make it through this supply. I'll likely try the pea protein next.  I went through a bunch of the Vega Sport protein; awesome product but a bit pricey.,2,0
"I bought this bread mix based on the reviews and therefore, expected an amazing loaf of bread. Unfortunately, the bread it produces is too sweet for my liking. It might be great for cakes and cookies, but unless you like sweet bread products, I would not recommend buying this product.",1,0
"This has a nice pleasant taste.  The artificial sweetness doesn't seem artificial to me, and it's not overpowering.  The strawberry flavor stands out for me (and to be honest, I really don't know what Acai really tastes like, so maybe it's there and I just don't notice it).<br /><br />But as much as I like it, I am unlikely to buy it again in its current packaging.  I guess I'm just not a fan of making a bottle at a time.  If this came in a form where I could make a pitcher at a time, it would likely replace the gallon container of Crystal Light that is always on hand in my refrigerator.",5,1
These are awesome Tomato's at a great price. Bought 2 cases. They are GREAT!!! Five Star Service. Excellent communication. Super Sonic Free Shipping!!! Thanks,5,1
"I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt. They don't overpower anything else I'm eating or drinking, very well balanced. Thanks Newmans' Own, another winner!",5,1
"AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED  BY AMAZON.

"I like corn and come from the northeast, where fresh, local corn is a common spring/summer side item, so I'd like to think I know from corn.  I tried a can of Glory's corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty.  Good stuff!",4,1
"Awesome alternative to soy sauce.  I received the 6 pack and had no issues with any of the bottles, all were intact not leaking and working properly!",5,1

"I got this as a small gift for my girlfriend who was always forgetting to buy more cheap popcorn at the store. I thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and I was right - she really liked them, especially the purple kind. We cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly. However, don't be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face! Does NOT feel good. Popcorn has a great, distinct flavor and I think we will be returning for more.",5,1
"These have a fresher chestnut taste than others I have tried.  For people who are looking for a healthy snack, chestnuts are probably closer to brown rice than they are nuts.  They are pretty low in fat.  I would recommend these.",5,1
I use O'Dells Popcorn Supur-Kist II Topping and sprinkle the Flavacol in the topping and use this as the oil for popping my corn and it it just like movie theater popcorn.  I love it!,5,1
"I enjoy dark strong coffee like Starbucks, french roast and sumatra.  I don't enjoy coffees with a sweet tangy flavor such as Dunkin Donuts and Gevalia.  To begin with, the Keurig Brewer tends to brew a slightly less bold or strong coffee than traditional methods such as a french press or even slow drip.  So for me, nothing other than extra bold K-cups will do the trick in the Keurig Brewer.  The strength of the Extra Bold Rainforest is strong enough for my taste (could be even a litte stronger).  The flavor is slightly smoky and rich but also slightly bitter with an almost stringent chemically after taste.  This however, is normally not noticeable.  I only notice it after immediately tasting another coffee.  Gloria Jeans Black Gold Extra Bold is smoother but also not as bold.",4,1
"It's not too sweet, not too bland. Just the right crunch. I like it with milk or mixed with yogurt.",5,1
"... Or maybe I just think that because it reminds me of the Coffee Time Syrup and milk I used to enjoy as a kid when I got home from school. (Yes, I'm a Boomer.) But I think the flavors are perfectly balanced. And there's NO crap in it (unlike some of their other drinks, and all of the Illy drinks). Discovered this stuff about 2 months ago and it saved me from being totally PO'd at Starbucks over the recent deterioration of their shops, which isn't limited to the coffee itself. Don't let me get started on that. :)",5,1
"I like the performance of all of the cytomax drinks.  This one has a weak flavor, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Others may like this flavor better than I do.  I like the grape and citrus best.",4,1
"I recently tried both the Peanut and Almond varieties of the Nature Valley Roasted Nut Crunch. These bars are amazing! Imagine the flavor and crunch of brittle, but with just enough of the syrup to hold the nuts together. Also the nuts are a little salty, so the contrast is nice. This bar is all nuts. With just 7 and 6 grams of sugar respectively per bar, the 7 grams of protein and 2g of fiber are really attractive.<br />My daughter likes these as a snack before swimming because they give her an energy boost. I like the fact that they are more nutritionally balanced than most snack foods. They tend to crumble when you eat them, so eating them in bar form can be a challenge. I break them before I open the package, and pop the pieces in my mouth. Either way, they make a great snack.",4,1
"Kitty crack!! My cats all love this! I give them a big variety of different types of canned food and this is one of their favorites. They will eat every bite! They seem to like the fish flavors the best but they like the chicken, too. This was a big hit in my house of 3 kitties so I highly recommend it!",5,1
We love these little bite size crackers. Great nibblers. Crunchy and cheesy goodness. Please don't make them hard to find. :),5,1
"If you are a backyard sugarer, you should definitely consider getting a maple syrup filter.  Just understand how large this filter is and make sure you are prepared to use it.  The 8-quart filter is 19"" tall, which may be larger than what many backyarders will need.",4,1
I am very happy with Earth's Best Formula and so is my baby. Although he is primarily breastfed I wanted to use formula at night.<br />After much research and trial and error I am glad to have found Earth's Best. With no sugar my baby does not get tummy problems or painful gas.<br />With Amazon subscribe and save it is really affordable too.,5,1
"We got the Kahlua and Gloria Jean's Vanilla coffee pods to try. I drink the Kahlua; my wife the vanilla. Both are mild blends with no bitterness. I get a hint of the distinctive Kahlua taste more from the coffee's smell than its taste. It has become my favorite. While I can't speak to the qualities/characteristics of Gloria Jeans' vanilla, I've noticed it has become my wife's favorite.",5,1
If you are craving Potato Chips and Dieting this is one to check out..They are better then traditional Potato Chips.  3grams fat per serving..it is remarkable..Try them and you will love them.,5,1
"Hi<br />I used to eat these when I was a kid living in Ireland. Whenever I go back there I pig out on them.<br /><br />So yes they are very good, but they are also the equivalent of crack. So if you do order this twelve pack, well this won't be your last order.<br /><br />You've been warned",5,1
"My baby loves these! She has been eating them since she was 6 months old. The veggie flavored ones and the organic ones are great. She doesn't care too much for the banana ones. I am a little concerned regarding the ""Made In China"" tag, but see other reviewers who have stated they are backed by an independent company as well. (There are multiple of reviews that have mentioned this statement).<br /><br />This product has saved me from many headaches and meltdowns as once she has it in her hands, she is quiet and content. happy baby, happy mommy. they melt in her mouth, she can hold them, they aren't hard like many other teething biscuits that crumble when you bite into them. Yes, if you put it in your purse, and place your wallet on top of it, it will crumble. Otherwise, it holds up well.<br /><br />definitely try a box. BTW, my older son loves these as well.",5,1
I love the k-cups in general but k-cup tea is my favorite. I love the lemon zinger in the morning it gets me going with out all the cafine.,5,1
"This really is the missing ingredient to all of your attempts at making traditional japanese food!  It may seem odd that fish is used as a ""spice"", but it really almost is just that.  I tried making steamed japanese vegetable with mirin & soy sauce figuring that Mirin was the missing ingredient.  But it wasn't until I read on one of the packages that hon dashi is required, that I discovered the true missing ingredient!  I bought fresh miso to make miso soup, and it too didn't taste right.  Added a spoon of hon dashi and suddenly I had real Miso Soup!  (actually i found out later you can buy fresh miso for miso soup with the dashi already added)  Hon dashi is great for soup stock for udon or soba too.  Buy some and add a little to whatever doesn't taste quite japanese enough.",5,1
Love the product but one of the cans was damanaged and leaked the contents in the box.  Horrible smell and a mess to clean!,5,1
"Having a neatly prepackaged lunch that doesn't need refrigeration is a good idea, but GoPicnic needs a lot more work on the items they are including in their ""picnic in a box"" before it's something I'll want to keep in the cupboard.<br />The packaging is cute - small and eaily portable - something you could throw in a bookbag or purse.  Some of the items included were fairly tasty like the dry roasted edamame and the dried fruit and nut combo.  I  enjoyed both.  The salmon spread, however, was completely disgusting.  It looked and smelled worse than any cat food I've ever seen.  Since I've never eaten cat food, I can't say which is better of the two.  I cannot imagine, however, that cat food could taste much worse than this stuff did. Also included were a small square of dark chocolate and some crackers which, while not impressive, were not unpleasant.  Overall, the box added up to more of a variety of snack items than a meal and at around $5 each, it's pricey for the amount of food you actually get. I wouldn't purchase this item again and, after the trauma that the salmon spread caused, I would be leary of trying other varieties of GoPicnic.",2,0
Package arrived on time; however some of the packs were ripped.  Other than that it was satisfactory.,4,1
"My cat loves cardboard scratchers and this was no exception. He shredded through the first side in one night. Now he is laying on it to keep the others away and let them know ""this is mine"". I love that cardboard scratchers are biodegradable and recyclable. The picture was deceiving, it showed a mouse toy but actually has a paper crinkle ball. This is okay since my  big boy would only be interested if it came with a live one. But my kitten quickly fished it out and deposited the little paper wad under the fridge.",5,1
"These are great! If you can, boil them for 3 or 4 minutes, then let them set overnight. They will turn out much better than trying to cook all at once.<br />Be sure to salt the water. Try adding cinnamon for flavor (or vanilla, etc). Next morning, heat them up, add some raisins or blueberrys, it' good and good for you.",5,1
"I've known I need to remain gluten free for over 25 years now, and have tried many, many gluten free products to get as close to the old ""normal"" days as I can.  The bottom line is that my wife and I purchase the Tinkyada products almost exclusively when we buy pasta (she eats it too despite not having to be gluten free).  And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we can't find most of their products in our reasonably large city - we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.  So for about the same cost, minus tax, minus travel or shipping, we get it direct and avoid extra expenses.<br /><br />As for the product, this is as good as any ""regular"" pasta I ever had in my ""past life.""  There's far less stickiness, and it holds up well for leftovers the next day.  It is not mushy or relatively tasteless like some of the other brands of gluten free pasta we've had in the past.<br /><br />When we give 5 stars, it's because it stands out as superior.  A really good product ""only"" gets a 4-star rating from us.  This one's a definite 5.",5,1
"Sahale Snacks are some of the best around.  They are great to pack along anywhere.  We love to sprinkle them on our salads for an extra special treat.  I prefer the pecans over  the other varieties, but I bet they are all great.  Hope you enjoy them as much as my family does.",5,1

As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away.

"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!",1,0
I sent these to a friend of mine who fell in love with them when we studied abroad. They arrived on time and apparently quite edible because she has been loving them! Only downside is the seller doesn't allow for any sort of note enclosure to let the recipient know who its from. Luckily this gift was a no-brainer as she knew I sent it.  Add in the option of allowing a written message and I'd give this 5 stars.,4,1
This is great for cooking all kinds of dishes. My order arrived in a very timely manner and I would recommend it highly.,5,1

"This honey is absolutely superb, especially if you get bored and need something to nosh on. I also found these nicely packaged honey stix to be absolutely convenient for when I'm at school. They're a quick pick me up after hours of being in lecture classes. They're the best form of sugar you can get, since honey is already pre-digested I also love the ""pop"" in your mouth. The best method to open these babies beside ravenously tearing into them, is to bend the straw, stick both ends in your mouth and gently bite down- the popping sensation is the best part! The ooze of honey is just perfect. I've had over 20 stix today, and I don't regret it! Great for dieting, too! Low in calories, and chock full of energy! :)",5,1
I have ordered many boxes of these and have been very happy with them until now.  For some reason the shipment was returned as undeliverable.  Same address as always.  One try at delivering it and they sent it back.  I'll get a refund.  Great.  I want my chips.  Moronic driver?,5,1
"Why am I a little disappointed you ask?  Well, this grain is not as clean as other quinoa I have purchased.  When I rinse the grain I get little floaties that look to be chaff. For this reason, I hesitate to use it in my toothed-impeller mill.  I wouldn't want to damage it, and if there is chaff, there could be other things.  Of course, the quinoa is delicious as always.",4,1
"This is a great cereal from Kashi. It has clusters of grains and nuts, and does NOT have high-fructose corn syrup nor sugar, yet it tastes sweet (they use cane syrup, which I assume is not processed like sugar). At times, I have made a meal on it by eating it straight from the box, like a snack. But is very tasty with milk, and doesn't get soggy very fast. My only complaint is that the picture on the box shows it with blueberries, but there are no blueberries in the cereal. This product is one we have bought many times and introduced to others.",5,1
"I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.",1,0
"i got so excited that when i found ""pemmican"" on amazon that i just bought it and didnt read.  yes it my fault that i didnt fully read the ingredients.. but when you advertise something as pemmican, shouldnt it contain dried meat and rendered fat?  this has no meat, no fat, and is not even gluten free.  what a disappointment.",2,0
"This is the best pizza sauce I have ever tasted. However, it's hard to find in my area.  I've been buying a few cans and packing them in my suitcase when I visit my parents.  I'm thrilled to be able to buy it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />The sauce is somewhat similar to the ""Italian"" version of Contadina tomato sauce, but it has more of an oregano flavor.  It includes chees, but doesn't have a strong cheese flavor; there's just enough to give it a smooth flavor.<br /><br />I use it as a sauce for frozen ravioli, in pizza soup, or just on plain pasta.  Also, use it as a dipping sauce.",5,1
"Thanks again for EXTREMELY Fast delivery time of 2 days here in my area. Also By far the best white chocolate on the market. This is so wonderful eaten by the piece, I'd never want to use it in a recipe. Save the lesser quality white chocolates for cookies and other baked goods.",5,1
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Breast, Glucosamine & Chrondroitin, 15-Ounce Blue Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>My dog loves these treats!  Finally, I have found a treat that's healthy, not only for his hips, but for his teeth, also.  They're nice & chewy.<br />I read food labels constantly, and it helps to be able to read the ingredients before purchasing on Amazon.  Also, buying Dogswell in bulk (15oz./pks of 3) as Amazon offers, is the best deal I have found, so far.  My 13yr. old, 33lb. dog gets 3 chicken strips a day.  The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer, whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh, and one last thing, Ranger Bob will bury pig ears, real bones, biscuits,""green bones"" etc. but not these Dogswell strips!",5,1
"OMG, these Lowrey's Jerky Treats are sooooo YUMMY! I've been addicted to these since my high school days in the mid 80's when they used to make them so dry that they about broke your jawbone. So much better these days with the same taste but not so dried out like dog treats. But, they seem to be really hard to find until I found them months ago at our local grocery store but others must have liked them as much as we do that they instantly sold out. They restocked them and days later they were gone once again. Argh! So I went onto their website where they directed me to Amazon where I ended up buying 2 sets (16) canisters so we'll have some for months to come. I just hope Amazon continues to carry these since we can't find these anywhere anymore. Thank Heaven for Amazon! : )",5,1
"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it.",5,1
I purchase one box of this just to try something different...well when I got it home and tried it...AMAZING flavor...When you drink it I do believe that it does suppress your appetite.  I did not know that was a benefit of this tea but it does work.  Another GREAT Stash Tea.  I also really enjoy the Vanilla Nut Creme Tea and Earl Grey by Stash.,5,1
i usually don't like tin cans.<br />these are nice artichokes and marinated.<br />not as small as some artichokes i've had<br />but the price is great and they taste very good<br />on many dishes. i placed them in a glass jar in<br />fridge / make sure you do the same. very nice.,5,1
"Amazon has a good price on this product compare to other places. This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box. If they can package it better it would have been a really cool gift. I originally bought it as Xmas gift to give to a friend, but the quality is not as good as my expectation so I decided to keep it. The flowering tea looks cool but don't expect too much on the taste. I wouldn't buy this product again.",2,0
I really liked this coconut water and got to drink all of them myself without hiding any in back of the old bottles of salad dressing because the rest of the family didn't care for them.,5,1
Great product! My pup is spoiled but these treats are his favorite.  He loves the peanut butter flavored ones the best.,5,1
"Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper ""tab"" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a ""best if used by"" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.",5,1
"I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!",4,1
"Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.",4,1
"Unlike one of the previous reviewers, this is one of my cat's absolute favorite variety. He usually will just lick the can clean while my other cat eats the food, but this is one he truly enjoys eating.",5,1
"Since Atkins discontinued their low-carb bread mix several years ago, we haven't used our bread maker. I was delighted to discover someone was still making a low-carb product and ordered Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix. I should have known we were in trouble when the anticipated ""fresh baked bread aroma"" never materialized. There was a slight smell... but not a good one. My wife and I both took one bite and had to spit it out. Initially, it was tasteless, but after a few seconds there was a horrible, disgusting aftertaste. We quickly toasted some regular bread to rid our mouths of the taste. Even with our regular toast slightly burned, it couldn't clear that disgusting aftertaste. Needless to say, the rest of the loaf went into the trash along with the 3 unopened packs of bread mix. This is the most vile, disgusting thing I've ever eaten. It's hard to believe that some folks actually gave this a positive rating.",1,0
"Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.",4,1
I look forward to weekends and my Keurig coffee maker. I have a variety of coffee flavors and this is one of them. I add a little more French vanilla creamer and it tastes great. This currently is available directly from Green Mountain for much less.,5,1
"Great tasting coffee at a very reasonable price. It used to be vacuum packed for freshness. Lately, the packages are no longer vacuum packed. Is it because of cost saving, or vacuum leakage? It would be perfect if they could blend in a more aromatic coffee, such as Kenya coffee.  Although it is labelled as Dark Italian Roast, it tastes more like a medium roast, which suites me just fine.",4,1
"Ok, the tea is great. But the description says ""Foodservice packaging, dispenser opening"" but that's not the case at all. You get a box, full of single serve metal pouch tea. That's it, no dispenser opening, no foodservice packaging.<br /><br />Just be sure to understand that you are getting a box full tea bags and that's all.",4,1
"wonderful right out of the box or topped with a slice of deli turkey and cheddar......aww, yeah....perfect snack or light meal.",5,1
"Great Price, Fast Shipping and these are the best chips with better ingredients and less calories than most snack foods-- plus they taste like real chips!",5,1
"Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.",5,1
"so easy to order from amazon, when you cant find something no where else, you can always find it at amazon.  five kids in the house, one of their favorite snacks.",5,1
"This is not what I would normally feed weanng kittens BUT .. when I put ""mama's"" food down and then their expensive kitten food - 5 of the 6 went straght for the Friskies Turkey bits. I opened another can and put it on a plate and ""smooshed"" it up with a fork - the meat in it was so tender that it did not take any effort at all. The kitties are almost seven weeks now and getting ready for new homes - in their goodie bag there will be a couple of cans of Friskies Turkey dinner.",5,1
"Our black lab mix almost choked to death on one of these. If I hadn't been sitting in the same room with her, we would have lost her. As the chew gets smaller, it becomes VERY slippery and it slid back into her throat and lodged there. I had to hold her mouth open and reach down and grab it - which, because it was so slippery - was not easy. I strongly suggest finding another way to keep your pups teeth clean. These simply are not worth the risk.",1,0
These are not the best peanuts I have tasted but I am having a blast experimenting with different roasting recipes. Much better deal than anything store bought brand.,4,1
"Upon opening, I immediately loved the smell! I love coconut so I was very pleased with the taste too! So far, I've put it on my neck, my hair, added to my rice, some milk, and some ice cream. Oh, and I've also gargled with it! I am excited to find many uses for this yummy stuff! I'll post an update about how it well it works when I've used it more.",5,1
This is a great product for my dogs. They love it and it is grain free for their allergy sensitivities.,5,1
"Purchased this on the advice of Dr. Mark Hyman, the well known author. I take a tablespoon or two with a glass of water right after breakfast and again after dinner and it keeps things moving, especially when eating a diet that's high in protein and low in fiber. Any other health benefits that come with it are bonuses as far as I'm concerned.",5,1
"I am an avid coffee drinker and like my coffee strong and black. When I order coffee, I all ways  order the darkest and richest roasts. I change the roasts up a bit during the week so I do not get tired of one or another.",5,1
great product super pump but don't put it in the refrigerator!  gets too thick to pump,4,1
I have purchased many different teas from SerendipiTea and have been more than pleased with them. This tea sounded great until i read the ingredients on the box. I am a vegan and it contains traces of dairy. It did not say this on the website. So i have to give it to someone else. But it smells amazing.,4,1
Very relaxing tea especially when you are all wound up from a long days work. Taste is good to.,5,1
"The saffron was not worh it to me. To receive such a small amount for the price means you get very little benefit. Also, because of how it is packaged, when you try to pour some out, it ALL comes out. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not worth the money.",2,0
"As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good ""healthy"" snack for when I have to have some jerky.",5,1
"If you have a Celiac Child or must be gluten-free, BEWARE.  I was taken in by the fantastic packaging, which mentioned wheat free/dairy free/ soy free. I stupidly thought this meant it was gluten free, and it is NOT!  It is full of oat and barley flour, which are not ok for Celiacs.  I wish this product would mention that it does contain gluten, or that they would make it with gluten-free oat flour, which is available (but this is not that). Dear Healthy Time: Either label this properly, or change to gluten free flours. You are misleading customers, and it has potential to hurt kids.",1,0
"Our dogs have been on Holistic Select for 3 years now, and we are very happy with it.  The ingredients are well balanced, natural and healthy.  Our dogs have shown a marked improvement in overall health, coat, energy and weight since switching to Holistic Select from a mainstream dog food three years ago.  Plus, they love it!",5,1
"I have used this flour in place of all purpose flour in cake, cookie and pie/tart crust recipes. Usually whole wheat flour has to be used in conjunction with AP flour because baked goods are too dense with just whole wheat. With this whole wheat pastry flour, you don't have to worry. It can have a more nutty flavor in crusts but it gets rave reviews from those eating the baked goods.",5,1
I am now officially addicted to these bars!! Excellent texture and taste! Will be buying them again and again. Wonderful for gluten free needs.,5,1
Would absolutely recommend this coffee brand and flavor to anyone who likes carmel in their coffee. Makes a very flavorful pot of coffee. I like the individual packets as it keeps fresh longer and is easier to store in the freezer or frig. You can smell this delicious coffee while it's brewing. I would highly recommend Coffee Masters Coffee in any flavor you like!!,5,1
If not these organic crackers are not for you. These taste so great in part because they contain yeast extract which acts a lot like MSG in the body. Please research yeast extract before feeding these to children and if you choose to use this product watch for behavior changes. We learned very painfully just how harmful this ingredient can be for some kids.,1,0
"Not very good. Powdery tea, little taste, little smell. Doesn't come close when compared to other loose leaf Ceylon brands.",2,0
"This was such a great deal, 6 boxes for only $17.60! Usually one box alone is $3.99! The ordering was easy and the shipping was extremely fast-by the end of the week! The product came in great quality also. Definitely recommend ordering from Amazon!",5,1
This is great coffee! I have a Bialetti Moka coffee maker at work and this coffee is absolutely delicious! Full bodied and bold but no bitterness AT ALL!,5,1
I use a lot of Paprika in some of my recipes and buying at my local market is extremely expensive.  So I was happy to find a good quality sweet Paprika available in large sizes.<br /><br />Good sweet taste and brick red color - exactly what I wanted.  Will buy again.,5,1
"Gotta say ... I'm impressed.<br /><br />I never purchased prepared baby food for my children, I made my own ... but my little grandson loves this stuff. I bought the fruit variety and vegetable variety packs for my daughter-in-law and also had the same shipped to me because I care for him while mom and dad are at work. The other fruits and veggies he is ok with but he goes bananas for the bananas.  I am ordering a case of just bananas because he likes it so much. I hope to have the time to start preparing homemade baby food by the time he runs out of what I already have.  If not, I will keep supplementing with Earth's Best brand of baby food.",5,1
"I admit at first I didn't think I'd like the combo of bacon and chocolate when I first tried one a year ago.  Flash forward to April 2012. I wanted to splurge a little and I decided to buy myself this bar as well as for a friend. Mo's Bacon Bar is much better than a mere candy of just having a slab of bacon covered in chocolate. It's sweet but not too sweet.  The taste of bacon doesn't interrupt the velvety smoothness of chocolate. The balance of sweet and salty is simply exquisite.<br /><br />I recommend this for any bacon and sweet-toothed fanatics alike. BTW, I do recommend this to be paired with brown ales or a good quality red wine.",5,1
"My fussy, older JRT mix won't eat hard biscuit type treats and I don't like giving him those ""fake"" bacon snax, I found these and bought a pack, thinking he won't like this either. I was happily surprised that he loves them and they're good for him, too. He gets to chew for awhile and I know they're a better treat choice for him.",5,1
"Again, great for later in the evening when you don't want all that caffeine before bed....love the fact that it is organic, easy and good tasting to boot.  Great pricing on the 6 pack too at Amazon.com",5,1

"A snickers is a snickers, not much to say about it.<br />However, the expiration date is for three Months from now which tells me that these snickers have been sitting in the warehouse for many Months already.<br />When I bite into the snickers it is quite obvious that this candy is not fresh at all...(ex: the caramel is not chewy, the chocolate flakes off into pieces when I bite into it telling me it is stale, etc.)<br /><br />I have been shopping on line for well over 10 years due to my being disabled, and I don't drive so I do almost all of my shopping on line, including, most of my food.<br />This has been the slowest shipping I've ever experienced with a seller...<br />So, let's see, I have very slow shipping from the seller, add to that the snickers are almost out of date and very stale, (in fact  I am going to toss them into the trash), I am left with a very terrible experience with this seller...what a rip....seller must be judeo/christian as money seems to be the bottom line!<br /><br />So needless to say I'll never, ever use this seller again, I would rather go without!<br /><br />Edit: problem is NOT with Amazon, I love shopping on Amazon, the problem is with D+J.<br />Amazon issued a refund for the stale candy....Amazon is the best!",1,0
"I really hoped for the best on this one after becoming disillusioned with my local coffee shop's organic ethically produced Ethiopian offering, but happily this is a great tasting cup of coffee.

Usually we need two pods per cup of other blends to make it work for us but not with the Marley Coffee. A+",5,1
This product is great for giving my little dog his medicine.  So much easier and less traumatic for the little dog.,5,1
My dog seems to like these.  He will not stop until all gone.  You can smell item while he is eating it.  Would buy again but not often cause of cost and they only last him about an hour and a half.,4,1
My cairn terrier Daisy loves these basted bones. Having trouble<br />finding them in retail. I hope its not a sign that the product<br />is discontinued. She also likes the peanut butter basted flavor.,5,1
"I order these on a regular basis.  Very low in calories, crispy and tastes just like apples.  Why go for the sugared, unhealthy snacks, when you can have the real deal?  Buy these huge bags and put them in snack bags to save money.  I can't recommend these enough.",5,1
"You've already discovered Tassimo, now discover one of their best and cheapest coffees!  This French Roast is just as good as the more costly Gevalia.  It's also better than the regular Maxwell House blend, I think it's called House Blend.  I used to buy it directly from Tassimo, but they have gone up a dollar per package so this is the best deal going.  Hope Amazon continues to offer it forever!",5,1
"This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra ""stuff"" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!",5,1
"It's 110% sugar and no substance.<br /><br />Do NOT feed this to your kids, and they will thank you for it.<br /><br />It's just white on white on white, and a couple of zig zags.<br /><br />Did I mention the amount of sugar packed into these nasty things?!?!?!?!<br /><br />I don't know HOW I used to EAT these things...Ugh.<br /><br />1.2 stars.",1,0
"I followed the review of other customers to buy this product. It turned out to be very good. First time I toasted too over and wasted a lot. Right now I will just toast on the furnace surface for about 1min until there is some smoke and smell coming out. It tastes quite good after toasting. But do not overcook, it can ruin the sesame and it can taste quite bitter.",5,1
I buy this coffee for my daughter.  She really enjoys it as her everyday regular coffee.,5,1
"Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.",5,1
"Anyone remember that old joke about Grey Poupon that involved two old sophisticated men in a limousine?  I remember that commercial with fond memories, and in fact is the main reason I avoided eating it for so long for fear that I'd become exactly like those men.  Good thing it was just a big joke and *anyone* can eat this stuff without desiring to feel high and mighty!<br /><br />The taste is good but it's not as appealing as it used to be.  I believe they're either making it cheaper these days or simply have changed their recipe for the worse.  Either way old time fans of this product that have been neglecting it over the years may be in for quite the disappointing surprise when they go to eat this overpriced stuff.",4,1
"Bought this to use in a batch of mead, but of course I had to taste a little sample. Mild flavor with slight fruit notes and a wonderful aroma. Slightly darker amber color should work well as I am adding 2 bottles of black cherry juice concentrate for a batch of cherry mead....yummm....<br />Y'all can put it on toast, I'd rather drink my honey...  Huzzah..",5,1
"No, I wouldn't eat these on a regular basis, but for an emergency food source, they are excellent.<br /><br />Everyone should have a 3 day Disaster Kit in their home.

If not, you should.<br /><br />These ravioli's are cheap, pre-cooked, and ready to eat out of the can. No, you don't have to heat them up, but it does help the taste somewhat.",5,1
"Usually diet sugar candies disappoint me (even natural ones).  However, we were not disappointed with this candy.  It does dissolve really fast, but the flavor is fantastic.  My kids think they are great as well as all adults who have tried them. My only objection is that they are so addictive.  I have to use self control to not eat too many at once.",5,1
"I love the Flavrz range and this is my favourite flavour.  One sachet will give a great taste to 1 litre (approximately a 32 oz nalgene sized container) for only 70 calories.  I SO appreciate the fact that there are no artificial sweeteners in this - I'm much happier with just the very small amount of sugar, agave and fruit juice which are present here, instead of the acesulfame, aspartame etc which you get in other products.  Tastes great, contains no nasties and hardly any extra calories.  Awesome.",5,1

"I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible.",1,0
"I love the Mrs. May's snacks. While i haven't tried them all, the black sesame is definitely a keeper. The almond crunch is great too. I have yet to be disappointed with any of them. Healthy and lower in carbs than many snacks. Just be careful as it's easy to eat the whole bag (2 portions or more depending on the size you get) which isnt good if you're watching your fat/calorie intake.",5,1
"I breastfed my daughter for her first month of life, but she had severe problems with gas, bloating, and constipation.  We switched to a milk based formula, but the problem continued.  We then tried lactose free formula.  The problem lessened, but did not cease.  By her second bottle of Alimentum, she was using the bathroom without stimulation, her stomach was no longer hard and bloated, and she actually lays around smiling (without needing to be constantly held).  This was important as I have 3 other children.  My only regret is that she was 2 months old before we figured out how to keep her little tummy from hurting.",5,1
"Very fast delivery, I haven't beeen able to find the bulk containers in the stores lately.",5,1
I appreciate being able to purchase this item by the case.  It is my favorite Winter beverage.,5,1
This is one of my favorites for our tassimo.  It is a medium flavor coffee I would say not being a coffee expert.  I like that it is automatically set for tassimo to make a 12 oz cup instead of the 8 oz cup.  Great flavor in the morning.,5,1

Since<br />using BBs my cholesterol has returned to an acceptable level<br />and I'm eating more vegetables and actually enjoying them. Also, fish sauted<br />with a a BBs and lemon juice sauce tastes like something from a gourmet restaurant!",5,1
"I was so looking forward to trying this coffee & expected it to be great, from the reviews, reputation, and price.<br /><br />After experimenting with more/less beans to try & brew the perfect pot, I'm about to give up.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm so disappointed I could cry.",1,0
The cheddar flavor is THE BEST. Sour cream and onion is not far behind. I hate the parmesan and garlic though - I taste almost a fishy after taste. The rest fall somewhere in between. Glad Amazon has them by the case - way cheaper than getting them in the stores.,4,1
I love this coffee with cream and sugar-free caramel syrup (with Splenda).  It has a smooth taste...perfect for my morning coffee.,5,1
"Much more affordable that in my local grocery store. I use this stuff as a moisturizer, in my cooking, as a base for cleaning products and even give some to my dog to keep her coat shiny. The coconut smell is actually quite mild, which I like, I don't like it to be overwhelming other smells/flavors. I bought another brand previously but it was hard to get all the coconut oil out, the shape of this brand's container makes it easy to access the full container. Just polished off the last jar after many months. Will keep buying this brand from Amazon.",5,1
"I first tried this product at my local Whole Foods grocery store and loved it!  What I really enjoy about it is that I'm not drinking junk, no chemicals, no additives, no food coloring...  Nothing bad!  Both flavors, the chocolate and vanilla, are tasty!  I'm also vegetarian and a majorly picky eater, so this product really suited my problems of not intaking enough protein.<br /><br />What made me a believer in this product is that I was given a suggestion to drink a protein shake, ala Orgain, about 15-60 minutes after working out at the gym.  I've given this a test trial for a week and noticed dramatic results.  I recover faster, easier, and I'm energized after the fact.  I sleep better at night too.  I missed dinner the day that Disneyland was open for 24 hours for Leap Day and took one of these along.  I felt great the whole night, only had three hours of sleep, and absolutely no fatigue when I went to work plus no ill-effects the following day.<br /><br />My boyfriend would scrunch up his face seeing me drink these.  He also is now a supporter of the product by caving into one of these yesterday night.  He came back home after playing a 1 1/2 hour match of ping pong, was really sleepy and tired, but wanted to go back out to play badminton.  He drank one of these and about 20 minutes later, felt good enough to go play badminton.  He said it felt like he was never tired initially and was still feeling good after playing for an hour.<br /><br />Instead of reaching for a Red Bull, soda, coffee, or something else with a ton of caffeine for a boost, drink this.  I subscribe for a monthly shipment for both flavors of this product now from this site for the free shipping + additional discount.  You won't regret it!  Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying this phenomenal product!",5,1
"These roasts are more flavorful,tender, and fulfilling than the best standing beef rib roast you ever had on a Sunday! No gristle, well-marbled, and in a great size for couples. You could even use them as pot roast although that would be a tremendous waste their great natural flavor.",5,1

"I was drinking another brand of tea which is not sold in any of the stores where I live or on Amazon. I decided to give this brand a try after reading all of the positive reviews.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in this purchase. The tea tastes like sugar water. The ginger flavor is not strong at all. Even the crystals are lighter in comparison to the other product that I was drinking. Luckily, this product was very reasonably priced so I won't feel too bad about tossing the remaining bags if I can't find someone to give them to.<br /><br />I can't fault the seller here. The product was reasonably priced and arrived on time. I would purchase another item from them, but not this one.<br /><br />Just my two cents.",2,0
"You're seriously missing out.<br /><br />These crushed tomatoes by Tuttorosso are in a class by themselves. Does for Red Sauce<br />and spaghetti sauces what Beluga Caviar and Dom Perignon does for a promising date!<br /><br />Any combination of this, Contadina tomato paste, and Hunts tomato sauce will yield a<br />spectacular sauce of a unique red color, and now you can flavor it the way you want,<br />but don't be shy with the fresh basil.<br /><br />Available at most local retailers I've found, and cheap at under $3. The best!<br /><br />BTW, I read the complaints posted here... OK, all I can say is that I have been using<br />Tuttorosso products for 10 years and never had a problem, this stuff is pretty consistent<br />in its quality.",5,1

"I'm almost not sure if this should be a morning drink or a dessert. It definitely has a wonderful pecan aroma and flavor. My fiance and I also would put this in our top 5 (and I think we have pretty much tried them all...) We tend to lean toward nutty, vanilla and caramel flavors as our favorites, so if you like those you will probably like this.  I found it to be a nice mild coffee (strength can be adjusted by choosing smaller or larger brew size) and as far as sweetness, adjust sugar to taste! If you're unsure about buying so many, try finding it in a variety pack, that is how we discovered it.",5,1
"... before they started using white sugar in all of their recipes.<br />(You can just skip to the last paragraph if you don't care to read the whole thing).<br /><br />Let me preface: A comment under one of my recent reviews challenged my credibility and accused me of 'not being discriminating enough, posting too many positive reviews in the row'.<br />While I have written many low star reviews in more distant past, recently I have deliberately focused on the products that I love, and that have truly been very useful to me over the years. However, in an effort to make my reviews more balanced, I set out to look for items that I feel merit low rating and it did not take me long to come up with ALL current Health Valley line.<br /><br />Consuming white sugar has caused numerous problems for my health and I had to, happily and willingly, give it up long time ago.<br />The founder and original owner of Health Valley, George Mateljan, was very passionate about good quality, healthy food and had pledged, among other things, to NEVER use any white sugar (nor artificial sugar substitutes) in his products. True to his word, ALL of his cookies, bars and cereal were delicious (even though a little pricey) AND they were sweetened with fruit juice only.<br />That's why these Amaranth, and also rice bran cookies and couple of his cereals used to be my favorite and a regular staple in my pantry.<br /><br />(Just a brief insight into the history of the company - he founded it back in 1970 and it was the first company to produce healthy prepared foods in the United States using fresh, quality organic ingredients. They introduced hundreds of convenient, delicious items that were packed with nutrition and flavor yet completely free from white flour, refined sugar, hydrogenated fats, excess salt, chemical preservatives and artificial colors that are so common in highly processed foods.<br />George participated in every aspect of the production at Health Valley and personally created most of recipes used.)<br /><br />That all has changed in late 90's, when the company got bought by Heinz.<br />Very shortly afterwards, an ""evaporated cane juice"" became prominent ingredient in all of their goods. Rose under a different name is STILL a rose, and no matter how glorified the politically correct ""cane syrup"" sounds, it STILL is a white sugar, a complete poison to my system.<br /><br />To my great dismay, there are so very few options these days for really tasty HEALTHY cookies, that would be fruit juice (or Xylitol) sweetened. Most of the 'sugar-free' varieties are made with artificial substitutes like Sucralose, that are even worse for human consumption than sugar itself.<br /><br />To sum up the previous: If consuming white sugar is not of any concern to you, then these cookies (and other bars and cereals from Health Valley) would still be a better option than many other commercial brands 'out there', thanks of the overall higher quality of ingredients.<br />For me, just because of the white sugar issue, all of their products have been off my list long ago.",1,0
These snacks are very good to take in lunches for work or at home. I look forward to ordering these snacks in the future.,5,1
I am so impressed with the Funky Monkey line of products.  They are great for kids and the taste is awesome!  I highly recommend this product.,5,1
"Okay, I read the reviews. And I asked my British friends what Marmite was like. Nothing gave me a clear enough idea, though, so I ordered some from Amazon and tried it myself.<br /><br />The verdict's still out. I neither hate nor love, much less like nor dislike, Marmite. I've tried it on plain toast, and I've eaten it on toast topped with eggs. The taste is a bit bitter, like the toast is slightly burned. That would normally be a turnoff, but Marmite is very salty, and that takes the edge off the bitterness.<br /><br />It's nutritious. You can smell B vitamins when you first open the jar. But I'm not sure the sodium content makes that a point in its favor.<br /><br />I'll probably finish the jar and forget all about Marmite. It's that underwhelming.",4,1
"Wonderful product. ""Instantly"" puts all ""instant oatmeal"" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the ""Tupperware"" you don't mind losing!). Into each container (""bowl"") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 ""ready to heat and serve"" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs.",5,1
"I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.",1,0
"This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar.  They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesn't show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.<br /><br />I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping.  Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size.  I don't think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.<br /><br />So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac?  Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to ""Absinthe Cocktails"" by Kate Simon).  I'll keep looking for other uses...",4,1

"I like to combine Tilda's Basmati & Wild Rice with the Jasmine Thai.  I am so glad that Amazon is carrying this rice, only I don't see the Jasmine Thai.  Anyway, I used to buy it years ago when it came out of a box.  Then for some reason, I believe Tilda took it off the market for a while, and then it came back in new packaging.  I have been buying it for about 5 years this time around, and the only grocery store I've been able to buy it, is now going out of business.  Thanks to Amazon I can now buy it on-line.",5,1
I used this product on my petunias. The flowers were being eaten by insects I believe were moth caterpillars. Within several days of initial application all damage stopped. Two weeks later i noticed some slight damage and a light application of the dust took care of that. Product works great would buy again,5,1
"We have been buying this Ramen for years whenever we can find it at the local grocery. It was so great to get it in bulk from Amazon. This has thicker noodles so they have some substance. It comes with two packets. One is seaweed and little chunks of mystery seafood, if you like seaweed you will want to use this packet. I love it because there is more then one kind one seaweed in it. The other packet is the soup/spice mix. It is hot and delicious. When I make this as just noodles I only use half the package, for soup you can chance the whole thing. Especially if you have a cold and want to clear out our sinuses. In fact, this is right up there with chicken soup as a great comfort food when you are sick and just want to sit on the couch with a hot bowl of soup and watch cartoons.",5,1

"I don't know what makes Organic coffee different from regular coffee, and in this instance, I honestly don't care.  I'm used to Starbucks coffee, as well as the occasional Pete's coffee, as well had coffee in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being strongest coffee, this Marley brand coffee is like a 2.  Weaker than the old-style McDonald's coffee (before McCafe's came about).  Weaker than instant coffee.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other flavors and nuances to this coffee, but I honestly can't get past the weak flavor.  Perhaps, if you like weak coffee, this may be for you, and maybe the organic process leaches stuff out, but for me, this one's not to my taste.<br /><br />At least the flavor's not bitter.",2,0
"These are tasty, fun snacks. They are easy to take along in a backpack or bag, and are pretty healthful.

I would not order them again.",1,0

"TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from ""tired"" to ""not tired"" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body.",5,1
This coffee is by far one of my favorites.  You can't beat it.  It has a great taste to it and I never get tired of drinking it.  It's a stronger coffee so you may not have to use quite as much as some other blends.,5,1

It's very pricey, but well worth it. He seems happier and I know WE are! :)",5,1
"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",4,1
"First off, the price on these is kind of weird. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZUFHW"">Thai Kitchen Mushroom Medley</a> is 6 for ~$11 ($.74/oz, just over what I pay at the store) and this is more than double that price ($1.62/oz). If I were reviewing the product itself, I'd give it four stars. Charging double what it's worth lowers my rating a good bit.<br /><br />The Thai Kitchen Noodle Bowls I've had (Mushroom Medley and Roasted Garlic) are both very good for instant soups. I prefer the Mushroom Medley, though. To me, the broths taste very similar (though Garlic is slightly stronger) but the Mushroom contains dried shiitake mushrooms. The mushrooms add more texture to the soup and make it taste less like just broth and noodles.<br /><br />This is still pretty good, though, and if you can find them at a more reasonable price ($1-2) and/or don't like mushrooms, go for it!",2,0

Her chomping down entire Greenies has worried me in the past.

It is much easier then lugging it home from the store. Even with pet store 'discount' member cards, the food is a better value at Amazon.",5,1
"This is a good product.  It's more expensive than typical supermarket cat foods, but you get what you pay for.  Blue Buffalo is one of about a half-dozen upscale, healthier, more expensive cat food brands.  Though there are proponents and detractors of each brand, honestly, they seem all to be on a similar plane in terms of the quality and healthiness of the food (Blue Buffalo, Evo, Innova, Wellness, etc.).  After reading a gazillion websites, I concluded that Wellness Core is probably the healthiest dry food out there, but our three cats don't like it much - it's like feeding string beans day after day to a kid; they just won't eat it.  They *love* the taste of Blue Buffalo.  So we mix 1/2 Wellness Core with 1/2 Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry to try to get the best of both worlds.  I can't overemphasize how much all three of our cats like the taste of the BB dry.  They will eat it as a meal, or mixed in with wet food, or even as their 11 pm snack-treat, when they are at their most finicky and demanding. All three of our cats like a wide variety of the Blue Buffalo flavors, but this particular product (for whatever reason) has really worked out well as the core of their diet.  There's no question that a lot of things improved with our cats, from digestion to fecal habits to coat shininess and smoothness, when we transitioned them over to Blue Buffalo.  I'm very satisfied with Blue Buffalo and with this product.",5,1

This is on my short list of products I can't live without.",5,1
"In the old days, water was water. Now days, consumers have their choice of bottled or tap, sparkling or flat, distilled or spring, and a hundred other options too complex for most to care about. In this case, Essentia is marketed as pH balanced at 9.5, meaning it is significantly alkaline (basic in the old parlance - the opposite of acidic) compared to traditional water, which falls roughly around 7 pH (give or take). Various websites will extol the virtues of this sort of waters, while others call it bunk. To me, however, all that matters is the flavor.<br /><br />Essentia water lives up to its label - it does have a silky smooth taste (or lack thereof). The problem is, it also has a slight chemical aftertaste that is most likely due to the added sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. I also experienced a mild dry mouth after drinking it which I attribute to drinking an alkaline substance in a mouth that generally runs either very slightly acidic or very slightly basic. These aspects are enough for me not to drink it anymore, though I have had significantly worse-tasting water.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of 5 stars. The mild chemical aftertaste is too much for me, but it still tastes better than Dasani.",2,0
My son loves Maple Brown Sugar Cream of Wheat so when I was offered to try the Quaker Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal I jumped at the chance to offer him something different.  It was a huge hit!

"I am 100% mexican and do make refried beans the old fashioned way, but it takes hours!!  I still make them occasionally, but these can't be beat for convenience and the taste is good too. (some other brands out there have odd seasonings added). You can doctor them up to achieve the flavor you desire.  I always have these on hand for after work quick mexican dinners!! Please, don't use canned, those are an insult to authentic mexican food.",5,1
"These peppercorns are exactly as advertised: sweet and fruity with a  tangy pepper overtone. I am still experimenting with which pepper to use with what dish, but I did try this on a lemon salmon and it was very good.<br /><br />I also want to note that the customer service from the company was excellent. I had a problem that I did not tell them about but I did put it in a review. A customer service representative contacted me and resolved the problem very quickly and at no cost to me. You can't beat that kind of service. I will be using Olive Nation again.",5,1
"My 18 month old and I LOVE  this pouch. Now, she's not picky, but I am: you just can't beat the nutrition and quality for the money. This little pouch has 90 calories, with fiber, protein and Omega 3's! I've got these suckers on Subscribe & Save - LOVE 'EM!",5,1
I have four cats.  One cat is totally addicted to this treats - she is ridiculous about it.  Two cats could care less; and the fourth cat likes them but doesn't get crazy about getting them like the addicted cat.  Love the subscribe & save for all my cat treats and foods - makes my life easier.,5,1

"Time and time again I've heard it said to ""get the green bag"" of Taste of the Wild. What's the ""green bag"", you ask?<br /><br />Well, recently TotW came out with an ""other"" formula, called ""Canyon River"". And, while it's not bad by any means, it IS different. Some cats like it, some cats don't. My cat isn't picky. My problem was that it smelled so sordid that I couldn't stand to feed my cat (read my review on it here). Since my cat liked the ""other"" formula so well, I decided to try the original formula in the ""green bag"". I found a good price locally and the pet shop owner told me about how the ""green bag"" was far superior to the ""other one"".<br /><br />And she was right. The Rocky Mountain Feline formula has everything I'm looking for in a dry food, doesn't smell like a hatchery, and is priced fair.<br /><br />My cat loves it, and I don't have any complaints.<br /><br />I'm sticking with this from now on.",5,1
"I was looking for noodles that were low in calorie with an ingredient list I could read. On top of it all, these taste great!

"So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein",5,1

"AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.<br /><br />They're lighter and crisper than the usual kinds of tortilla chips that come in brown paper bags, and they have the taste of olive oil, black pepper, salt and olives.<br /><br />I ate them right out of the bag, but I could see them working well with some kinds of pate or hummus, too.<br /><br />The main down side:  one 6oz bag contains 840 calories, and they're quite addicting.",5,1

"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea! I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't! We don't care of these AT ALL! The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny! They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable. We have been slowly making our way through the 12 box so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away! If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 12 bags of various yucky flavors!",4,1
"Now I know what evil tastes like! I literally had to plug my nose to choke this stuff down, and I eat really healthy on a regular basis.

To top it off, my bottle arrived with the cap busted. I won't be purchasing this again.",1,0

My cats will only eat the turkey cans.  They refuse to go near the beef or chicken.  They used to lvoe this stuff when they were kittens so I am not sure what happened.  I switched them over for over a year to mostly seafood varieties and now that is all they want (however I am not sure its the healthiest).  I am tryign to get them back on poultry/beef but they are not thrilled.  Even the turkey takes a while to get eaten (unlike the shrimp and fish feast variety which gets gobbled up in seconds).<br /><br />I will be giving these cans to my aunt for her cats and will deal with the loss of money.  Other than that - the price here on Amazon was great and it shipped right on time.  Amazon prime is really great - free 2 day shipping cant be beat!  :),2,0
This was a gift I gave to various members of my family.  To a person they were delighted with the variety of flavors to sample.,5,1
"Ahhh research.....it needn't be reading or testing product 100% of the time.  Taste testing is a pleasure when it tastes like these thin, cookie like disks.  They are a perfect compliment to coffee, and possibly hot tea.  They do not work well with iced tea for some reason. The specific taste is hard to place...somewhere between a butter cookie, fig, and raisin.  These thins are at their best when nibbled slowly with a late morning cup of coffee - oral confection heaven.",5,1

"I have the yixing clay teapot, I buy tea that can go up to the triple digits, I'm a total tea snob.  I LOVE good tea, LOVE it.<br /><br />So, having ""fresh green tea"" in a bottle sounded uhm, suspect at best.<br /><br />No, this is delicious!  Obviously, this wont stand up to standards of extremely expensive teas, but ito-en makes excellent teas to begin with, and these are brewed to perfection.  Quick, convenient, very healthy, and SO delicious, and I'm a harsh critic.<br /><br />I go through them like water now.  I have a subscription ordering 2-3 crates of tea per month now :3 I may increase the amount of crates per delivery now though.  It's so good!  Not only that the bottle is attractive, the mouth piece is comfortable (a thicker, white, higher quality plastic) and the ergonomic square shape lets there be more tea in the tea in the bottle for a smaller size.<br /><br />I love this stuff, its a great value for the price (currently $23 for a case of 12) is very reasonable considering how much I pay per bottle in the store!<br /><br />However, it is imperative, as I should hope one would know, that you do drink the tea within 2-3 days at most.  Leaving it open longer will alter the taste for the worse :x",5,1

"The product was offered for review because of the packaging.  They are stacks of square crackers, one half of the large ones that we are used to.  They come in two serving packs. I liked having the crackers already broken in half, because that's the size I give to a child.  I think I'd prefer to have re-sealable packaging, but this wasn't bad.  We never did have to eat soggy or stale crackers.<br />Just be aware, this is a package that is a right size for having several toddlers hanging on to your skirts, not a size pre-packaged to put in lunch boxes.",4,1

Plus, my dogs love its taste, and it's a great value for the quality of this food.  I'd recommend it to any dog owner.",5,1
As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed. We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.,2,0

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo.",1,0
"Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables. The primary ingredients are chili, salt, garlic and distilled vinegar. It does contain preservatives, namely potassium sulfate and sodium bisulfite so if you are allergic to sulfites you might want to avoid this sauce. Be forewarned that it is very potent so a little goes a long way. As with any spice, just add a little at a time until you reach the amount of heat that is right for you. I can't wait to mix a bit in with my pizza sauce. It is a five star sauce but I deducted a star because I think it is rather pricey.",4,1

"Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.",5,1
"Wow, I was very surprised by its great reviews, it made me curious. I loved Yogi Tea's Blueberry slim, so I thought I would give this a try, and I LOVE IT!

Thank you for the awesome reviews because I love this tea now, it will be my favorite green tea from now on.",5,1

"This is the non-organic version of its organic sister.  I've used them both and cannot see a difference.  Therefore, I'm repeating the same review I published for the organic version without any reservations.<br /><br />My favorite oil ""cold pressed virgin olive oil"" has one big flaw; it cannot handle high temperatures, and can be a little too flavorful for some dishes. And forget about what's called ""pure olive oil"" for those problems. It is no better than any other commercial oil. That's where the canola oil comes in. It's actually better than olive oil in some other ways, notably the omega-3 content. But it's not easy to find cold pressed canola oil, and when you do it's priced at obscene levels.<br /><br />I've been delighted to find out about this product, and it hasn't been disappointing. I use it generously in many dishes except in desserts, for which I use virgin coconut oil (another delight).<br /><br />UPDATE: At the time I originally reviewed this product, they offered organic and non-organic versions.  I'm glad to see that they only offer the organic canola oil now.",5,1
"The product seems to be alright (I have not yet used it. Have it stored in the fridge until I'm ready).  However, I notice that there is no shelf life date on the package and there is no advice as to how I should store the item BEFORE I use it.  It does recommend refrigeration AFTER I open the package.  I would appreciate having had this information prior to purchase.",4,1
These are very good.  They have an amazing strawberry flavor and a great chewy center!  I love these!  I have tried one other brand which tasted kind of fake.  I will be buying these repeatedly!<br /><br />On my third order and these current bags are sort of defective because many of the pieces do not have the soft center.  They are still good but I like the soft center the best!,5,1
"I buy this every time it goes on sale!  The cans are large, so you can drink it slowly during the day, for maximum effect!

Over the past 2 weeks I've been transitioning my 10 month old cat from dry to wet food. This is the only wet food that he really eats with enthusiasm. I really think it helped in the transition. We've also tried Wellness Core and EVO (also high quality foods) but he likes this stuff the best.,5,1
"I don't use VIA packets frequently, but I like to keep them on hand. When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently.",4,1

Our dogs love the Everlasting Vanilla Mint!  One dog will licks and the other dog chews but it takes them a long time to finish them when they are in the treat balls.  The treat ball has provided them with hours of entertainment this winter when we haven't been able to get out much.  We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.,5,1
"I was so happy to find this product online, it is difficult to find consistently in stores.  My two dogs showed noticeable improvement (after 2 weeks) from stiff joints.  A healthy 15 year old with the expected stiff hips and a romping 9 year old who has dry joints (who doesn't?).  They both love the taste and I'm happy not to have to crunch up the supplements into their food everyday.  I love the healthy ingredients and lack of fillers, I believe that is why my dogs live long lives. I put it on auto ship!  Yay! No more trips for the forgotten dog food!!  Thanks Amazon!",5,1
"I purchased this seasoning last spring at our local grocery and used it on everything--pork, seafood, veggies, burgers, you name it--all summer long. Imagine my dismay, when I went to restock, to find the store was only carrying it during the grilling season. Granted, it's great on grilled food, but I used it in so many other ways (a little on eggs is amazing).  There is some zing to this spice blend but it isn't so hot it overrides all other flavors of the food. I have also used several of Emeril's blends and like this one better.  Also, although it is not stated that this blend is gluten free, I cannot tolerate gluten and haven't had problems using this product.) When used liberally on meats it is easy to get a restaurant-blackened flavor with this spice. I absolutely love it and was so happy to see Amazon had some and at a reasonable price. I'm stocking up!",5,1
This tea is amazing. It tastes so good I switched from coffee to Teavana's tea. I feel lost with out a cup in the morning and a couple more throughout the day. The teavana travel mug is worth the $$$ invest and you will have delicious warm tea with you all day.,5,1

"I was hesitant to order this product, not knowing how strong the mints would be, and with it being a whole case of 12.  But they are very tasty.  I've shared them with at least 15 people, and most of them liked the flavor.  Some found the licorice flavor to be strong, but if you like licorice jellybeans, you will like these.  It is best to let them dissolve slowly, rather than chew them quickly.  The flavor does have a soothing effect on the throat.  The scent is very strong.  People notice that you are using them if they are nearby.  If you leave them in a drawer or cabinet, the scent will surround the space.  But I think they are worth it because they are different, not quite a mint, and leave a good feeling in one's mouth after you have had one.",5,1
"I gave my  14 year old terrier these treats and really believe that these have helped him to feel better. He has lately been playing with his ball, (he self plays and had not been doing this for years) happy to watch him on long walks. He is very happy to keep walking. He is doing very well",5,1
Made this and chapati one Saturday night for guest.  The loved it!  The finished the curry sauce with a bosten butt I made for BBQ.  I almost think pulled pork cooked in this instant curry mix is better then chicken.<br /><br />Wife had me make a second batch on Sunday.,5,1
"I LOVE this protien bar.  Best that I have EVER had.  Do not order in the summer.  I got them and they were totally melted, BAD.  I did find that by refrigerating them you could at least salvage the bar.",5,1
"You can fill these cups with liqueur, sauces, mousse or anything else that you can dream up.  At a recent baby shower I filled them with raspberry liqueur and chocolate mousse and they were a big hit.<br />Langs chocolates is a wonderful company to do business with.",5,1
"I don't like long reviews... and this is a simple item: healthy popcorn with caramel and chocolate drizzled over it. People, it's good. You should buy this item for the simple fact that 1 pack only has 130 calories and is filling and tasty. 5 stars for a great product that meets the sweet-tooth without adding to the belly. Thanks, Snackwells!!!",5,1
"I am a fan of Lipton Iced Green Tea so when I say the new Lipton Tea and Honey Decaf Iced Green Tea on Vine I had to give it a try.  The flavor is great and it fits the bill for anyone does not want artificial sweetener in their drink.  There is a trade off.  While the original Iced Green Tea had no calories, The Tea and Honey has 5 calories per serving.  Another plus is that while there is soy lecithin in the The Iced Green Tea there is none in Tea and Honey.  While some people say that soy in lecithin form does not bother people who are sensitive  to soy not having to worry about soy is nice.  I got the Strawberry Acai flavor and found it mild and enjoyable.  I did notice that it took longer for the Tea and Honey mix to dissolve but that was a minor problem.  I will be switching to the Tea and Honey now that it is available.",5,1
"I don't understand anyone claiming this fine tea lacks strong, rich flavor. It's the best bagged black tea I've discovered, though we've enjoyed PG Tips and Yorkshire teas. This ""Irish Breakfast"" tea is strong, without being overly tannic or sour. It's not like loose Lapsang Souchong, being a far more mellow smokey experience. If you crave an authentic, comforting tea that reminds you of being far from the maddening crowd, perhaps in a safer environ of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011B9W38"">Midsomer</a> than Badger's Drift, than this is the tea for you. We like it with milk & sweetener, though it's wonderful with honey or sugar.",5,1
"Why gamble with your dog's health? These are made in China.<br />Since Chinese manufacturers have proven that they don't care if they make Chinese children sick and die,<br />why would they care about American dogs??<br />I wouldn't have checked even ONE star but this review would not post<br />until I checked one.<br /><br />Check out Nature's Variety Brand products instead.",1,0
"Tried Jet Fuel at the fire station I work at.  The stuff wired me until almost 2am (drank around 1pm).  Very strong coffee, will for sure wake you up in the AM, I pack one just in case I have a long shift! Love the taste, great product!",5,1
"I drink my coffee as coffee, nothing added.  In my opinion, Caribou Blend is the very best K-cup coffee out there.  The blend is perfect and the taste is smooth, not too bitter.  Also, about the caffeine - You get your morning wake up with no jitters.  My number one K-cup.",5,1
"We frequent Whole Foods and love to buy the larger ""Pop Chips"" that they make. They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack.",4,1

"I am German but have lived in the United States for almost 13 years now. It truly pains me to see what Haribo has decided to sell here in the US under the ""Gold-Bears"" brand. Anyone who has ever tasted the real thing will know immediately how fake these are - by simply looking at them!<br />You can tell right away that their German tagline ""No artificial flavors or colors"" does NOT apply here.<br /><br />Imported from Turkey? If you're going to ship all the way from over there, why not give the American consumer something worthwhile...?",1,0
"My cats love these, so I ordered 2 boxes.  One box had been already opened & 1 package of 12 was missing.<br />Is someone in the warehouse hungry for cat food? Or maybe they needed to feed the warehouse cats, I don't know.<br />No response yet from Amazon about replacing the missing package.",2,0
"I tried this one as well as the one with the knots in the middle.  I had to take each one away after a few hours, wait several days and give it back to her to finish up in a few more hours.  It also gave her gas.  I do have an aggressive chewer which is why I tried these rather expensive rawhides.  I will not purchase again.",1,0
"These are some of the most delicious licorice twists I have ever had! I wasn't sure what they would taste like but was pleasantly surprised when they had a punch of sweet and tangy flavor. It didn't take long to finish off this pack of twists as everyone in the house kept going back for more. Even my son, who has never liked twizzlers, thought these were delicious! I like that they are organic and has a short and simple list of ingredients. They are about 100 calories for 4 twists, which is pretty steep, but worth it I would say!",5,1
The DVD arrived in brand new packaging and I received it timely and when I was told that I would.  Would buy again.,5,1

"Many of these exploded making a huge mess with grounds spewing in and out of the cup and onto the counter.<br />After the first one I thought maybe there was one bad one.  I have seen it before with Green Mountain brand but rarely,  Maybe one out of 10 boxes.<br />After the third one exploded I tossed the remainder in the trash.",1,0
"It was not as bad as I thought.  It was very tolerable and I only drank it in water.  I was very pleasantly surprised as, let's face it-green stuff typically is awful!  Not this.  I am very delighted with this product.",5,1
"Its an outright lie that this product is garlic oil.  It is garlic flavored soybean oil an its simply outrageous that they have the gall to market it as garlic oil.  If I wanted oil from gene modified soybeans I could run down to Dollar General and get a lot larger bottle for $1.  Of course I'd have to crush a garlic clove or 2 to flavor it, but at least I'd know that it was actual garlic in it rather than the ""garlic extracts"" that Roland uses to flavor their soybean oil.  This product stinks, and I don't mean of garlic.  Amazon should not even allow this fraudulently labeled product to be distributed through under their banner, but at the very least one ought to be able to put a minus sign into the rating so I could give it a minus 5 stars.",1,0
"These were awesome!! They have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. I bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. Didn't care for the salt and pepper, but loved the rest. Will definitely buy more!",5,1
"These worked great for the breast cancer awareness bake sale. They looked great, showed up in perfect condition, and tasted good.",5,1
"These are excellent. I was worried they would taste too natural and not really like a cookie, kind of like the difference between Kashi cereal and normal cereal but they taste like any high quality Choc chip cookie and have the added benifit of being a little bit more healthy. Easier to justify than a pack of oreo's...<br />All in all a excellent product that arrived in perfect condition and I have a active once a month subscription for them, for the last 3 months.",5,1
I absolutely love this mac and cheese.  I eat it at about one night per week for a fast and delicious dinner.,5,1
The tea was very weak because the tea leaves are unable to steep in the water. The water flushes through quickly resulting in a weak cup of tea. I will try less water and see if that helps.,2,0

"I have long loved this hot cocoa but each year it gets harder and harder to find. Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.",5,1
"Tried several different flavors at this point...this is flat out the best.  It just has a good coffee taste, not too strong or too mild.  I can get away with two little french vanilla creamers and no sugar (even considering I tend to like the sweeter side of the coffee spectrum).  Everyone in my office likes too.  I picked up at Sam's Club one time for $33 for the 108 count that I think they are offering here currently for $59.",5,1
"I really enjoy this cereal, appreciate its health benefits, and have an Amazon ""subscription"" for it.  I also enjoy the ""no sugar added"" Familia Muesli.  The main downside of this Alpen product is that each box is small, and consequently lasts me only three breakfasts or so.  For that reason, the Familia product might be a slightly better value.  I buy both products just to have some variety.",4,1
"Very crisp and light, drenched in exquisite european dark chocolate . you can enjoy it with fresh cup of coffe or as on the go snack.<br />Its just perfect in sweeteness and texture.",5,1
there is a difference among 'salts' - I am going for iodine in the product and there is - the SOSALT 'fine' does enhance the flavor of anything I've been using it on - just a lite sprinkle - perfect table and cooking salt.,5,1
"First of all, I would like to comment on the previous review for this item.  The customer gave it rave reviews but said that the gum came with a ""grainy coating"" that's horrible.  Of course its horrible.  Its a special type of sand!  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THE SAND, YOU HAVE TO RINSE OFF EACH PIECE BEFORE YOU USE IT.  The sand is a testiment to the excellent quality of the product.  For over 3,000 years, the gum has been harvested the same way.  The trees are scared and the ""sap"" drips down to the ground.  The ground is covered by harvesters with a special, clean, white sand to keep the ""sap"" from becoming dirty when it hits the ground.  After it hardens into ""teardrops"", it is then collected.<br />Mastic Gum kills bacteria that cause plaque and other dental problems.  Whitens teeth.  And it tastes absolutely natural....similar to the way patchouli smells.",5,1
These cookies are tasty and fresh upon arrival. I definately wouldnt mind eating one of these everyday for thirty days! As far as increasing milk production I cant really say if they did or did not. I am an exclusive breastfeeder. I would have had to pump in order to concretely say if I had more milk or not. That being said these cookies are tastey and they do have ingredients in them that are known to aid milk production. Give them a shot if your interested!,4,1

"I'm originally from China but I don't really cook. This is the best teriyaki sauce I could find here in the US. Both my hubby (American) and my 7-year-old son love this. It's so easy - I usually use pork chops (am sure you can use other meat), just lightly fry the meat and add sauce to simmer (cover and turn heat to low). You'll have to simmer the meat for at least 20 minutes though. I got this from Costco but they don't carry this anymore. I'll have to order from Amazon now since I couldn't find anything better than this. Highly recommend to anyone who loves Chinese.",5,1

"I have always loved these chocloates however in the past several purchases (from other venues) the liquers inside have been dried to sludge or gone completly.  I read the Co. comments & decided to take a chance.  It was a good decision.  They are wonderful!!  Quick delivery, well packed and just as promised.  I will buy from again!",5,1
"I decided to try these out after seeing a promotional price, and I am SO glad I did.  At first I was wondering what in the world I was going to do with FIVE POUNDS of lollipops, but I now realize that won't be much of a problem around my house (expiration date is two years from now, so there's another plus).<br />The flavors are very unique - not too sweet, not too tart.  My children love them!  I also like the size - I don't feel too guilty giving these to my children when three lollipops (serving size) is 17g sugar.  They're the perfect size.<br />According to the package, they are organic, no artifical dyes or flavors.  I've started taking them to work and they go fast - much, much better than your run of the mill store-bought treat.",5,1

"When I was pregnant, I was looking for a way to help stay hydrated because I was getting tired of drinking so much water.  So I bought a can of this at my local grocery store to try and it did the trick - one glass a day helped me break up the monotony of drinking water all the time.  This tea is made with sugar, which I prefer because I don't like the taste of sweeteners.  The raspberry flavor is delicious and I enjoy it more than Snapple which used to be my favorite raspberry tea.<br /><br />It's extremely easy to make and the powder dissolves pretty well (it's a little harder to get it to dissolve if the water is extremely cold, so I typically use cool water and then add some ice cubes to it after I've stirred it).  I found them at local grocery stores (Publix and Winn Dixie) for about $8/canister, so you're basically purchasing two and getting the third free here on Amazon.",4,1
"The bar has almost no cashew but lots of dates. The bar should be labeled ""Almond Date Bar."" The label is misguided.",1,0
"We purchased our machine from Great Northern Popcorn 18 months ago, and have managed to consume several cases of this product for use in the machine.  Completely satisfied, as the consistency provides the same great product time after time.  Have recommended to our friends, who love not only the taste, but the machine.  Could not ask for a better product.",5,1
"I have been buying the Maranatha Creamy Peanut Butter and finally decided to buy the almond butter 6 oz.($3.99) and when I opened the jar, some of the oil spilled out. So be careful when opening the jar, it is very runny compared to the peanut butter. However, the taste is so good and love the fact that the only ingredient is organic almonds. I highly recommend giving this a try if your looking for all natural organic almond butter! It is expensive but well worth it!",5,1
"Since I can no longer get the product from my local grocery stores, I turned to Amazon to continue my healthy eating journey. Love the promptness and convenience.",5,1
"I am on a low sodium diet. I look for ingredients that will add flavor to otherwise bland dishes. The Roland Balsamic Glazes are great on a wide variety of foods. I have tried them all, regular, fig, pomegranate, blood orange and tamarind. I like them all. A couple of other things I like a lot are sesame oil and Chef Jimmy's My Mojo. My Mojo delivers a great deal of flavor for a small amount of sodium.",5,1

"If you like dried manogos, don't buy these because they are not.  they may have started out as mangos but by the time they were mashed, sugared, colored, and shaped they resembled mangos and tasted like sawdust with a lot of sugar and some flavor that vaguely resembled mangos.  After my experience with this company, I will never do business with them again.",1,0
"Not 100% Organic, which is a shame. But it has a great texture. Its awefully sticky, but I like that. As do 2 out of 3 people that I sampled. 7g of protein which is pretty good and 5g of fiber. Great for a mid afternoon pick me up or those on the way to the gym. Because its a softer texture and raisins and perhaps the myriad of syrups, its awefully moist and doesnt need to be washed down with water like other 'trail mix' type bars. Its also gluetin free for those people who need to worry about that. The raisin really did seem particularly fresh. Not too much in the vitamin and mineral dept unfortunately. The sticky texture got a little much, for my tastes and the bar was a little small, but all in all highly recommended! Enjoy!",4,1
I've got an antique kitty (9 Lbs.) who was retirement age when she adopted us in 1994...

"I purchased this tea for a neighbor when she had mentioned that she loved the taste. I then went and purchased a pack of 120 (a bit much, I know) but it was totally worth it. The tea has a spicy, yet citrus-y taste that is both refreshing and aromatic. I highly recommend this tea for anyone whom is looking for a new 'everyday' flavor of tea.",5,1
"I bought the Tug-a-Jug after having bought the Twist n Treat. It's a good toy, but I would say it's ideal for a dog of above-average intelligence. The Twist n Treat only requires your dog to nose it over. This one has a more complex mechanism that requires more work. Our dog couldn't get much out of it the first few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so. The advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good. In all, I like this toy, because it's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser, which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her. If you are looking for a first food-dispensing toy, I would recommend getting the Twist n Treat first, however.",5,1
We are very pleased with our purchase of Greenies.  The price was grteat (compared with the pet stores) and the service was excellent.  Our dog is even more pleased than we are - he loves them.,5,1
"This ginger/lemon beverage was such a nice surprise. Usually when you get something with ginger you barely taste it but this product has quite a big punch of hot spicy ginger with a touch of lemon and just sweet enough but not too sweet. Also no artificial sweetener which is a must for me. I just so happened to be coming down with a stomach bug when this arrived and it was just what I needed to fight the nausea and upset. I will buy this again, it was a nice convenient  way to get a cup of my beloved ginger tea without having to grate the root myself or squeeze the lemon. This tastes just like I did all the work but all I did was boil the water! If you find fresh grated ginger too hot and spicy this is not for you, it is very spicy and wonderful!",5,1
"I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.",5,1

It smells good but not overpowering, controls any odor, and doesn't irritate my skin or leave marks on my clothes. I'm very satisfied and don't mind using a women's deodorant.",5,1

I have found that by adjusting my routine it is not so difficult to give it the 30 minutes.  I won't be ordering the 5-minute stuff any more.  Highly recommended...",5,1

I have been enjoying medium and dark roast Senseo coffee for several years. I find the quality cosistant and excellent taste. The Senseo coffee machine is simple to use and creates a cup of coffee very rapidly. I particulary like the foam that the machine automatically creates on each cup of coffee which adds a special taste feature to the early sips. Over time all of our guests have always enjoyed and complimented us on the fresh and good coffee. I purchase all my Senseo coffee from Amazon. Their pricing is more favorable and delivery is always efficient.,5,1
"These treats come in small (cat) packages and large (dog) packages.  I save money by buying the dog size for my 5 rescued cats and breaking up the larger pieces.  I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around.",5,1
"My dog loves these.  Problem is if we give him a whole bone or if he eats one close to sleep time...he pukes it up...Not sure why. We ususally just give him a half and he does better with that.  He would eat 10 of them if we let him, so he does love these bones.",4,1
"First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes ""down""! [Note: DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces!]<br /><br />Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money. The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around the dog's medication). Do a little research, and you'll save money. BTW, the multi-bag deals online at Amazon are not necessarily a good deal, be sure to divide the total cost by the number of bags you receive to see if you're saving $$.<br /><br />NOTE: The size listed on the Pill Pocket's bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small or a piece of a large pill pocket. These things are great, and go down my dogs easily.",5,1

"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).",5,1

This is supposed to be a light roast coffee but it states extra bold on the label. How can a light roast coffee be extra bold.

I brought home several bottles of the stuff and each year we went back bought more. Sadly, I haven't made the trip in a while so I found myself scrambling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was unable to find a normal sized bottle (23 oz will go bad before I can use all of it) but I didn't want to buy a bunch of small bottles either. the 4 star rating may or may not be fair as it has nothing to do with the quality of the product, but rather the way it is sold.",4,1
"I'm no expert baker, but I've had great success using this in a variety of baked goods. It makes them a little lighter than the bread or regular unbleached flour options provided by this company. I've purchased two or three of these so far and plan to continue.",5,1
"I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.<br /><br />I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD.",5,1
"Seems good, gave to family and they seem to enjoy it with no problems. No complaints of spillage.So far so good.",4,1
"The Kiwi Berry flavor has a tarty but sweet taste. Neither the strawberry nor kiwi is overpowering. Instead, I was treated to the best of both flavors! There was very little carbonation. My favorite Switch flavor!",5,1
"I have a Basset Hound and a medium mixed breed. They love these little chicken treats. I say ""chicken"" and they run to where the bag is kept. It's the one treat I can always get them to do their tricks for! I used to get them at a dog shop in a town over an hour away. Now, I get them on Amazon for a fraction of the price and they're delivered to my door every month (free shipping).",5,1
"Pop a couple when you are getting sleepy while driving. Doesn't last long, but does the job and improves road safety in a flash.",4,1
Great taste and excellent nutritional value. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a high protein shake or meal replacement. This fills me up a lot more than a standard protein shake. Will buy again...,5,1
"I purchased these at Trader Joe's.  If you like cacao nibs they taste great.  These are the nibs covered in dark chocolate.  This is relatively small container which contains two servings of one tablespoon each.  If you live near a Trader Joe's, you can buy these for $2.00 per tin.  Note the my rating is for the taste, not the price.",4,1

"Having been gluten sensitive for quite some time now, I have been searching for a good tasting bread.<br />I saw a small package of Pamela's bread mix in my local grocery store, and bought it. At the same time, I noticed a video on utube, showing how simple it is to make. All I can say is I was amazed! No bread that I have tried, even comes close for taste, and ease of preparation. When I saw the price of several large bags, on Amazon, and the savings-compared to the price of small bags- I had to buy it. You will have to purchase your own yeast packets ( they come in the small bags ) but try it, you'll like it.",5,1
"This is my third re-order of this excellent product. No one sells it at a more competitive price than Amazon and the door-to-door shipping is a blessing. A handicapped friend of mine, on a very limited income, has five cats who I've helped to feed for about a year now. They've never been healthier since starting on Natural Balance and the convenience of buying it online and shipping it to her home has bridged our gap of 2,000 miles. Thank you. Great product. Great price. Great service.",5,1
"I read all of the reviews before purchasing and seeing that I tend to be optimistic, I got really excited when I came across this product.  Unfortunately, it does not come close to looking nor tasting like much.  I tried desperately and so did my son, but it did not cut the bill.  If you are looking for a pasta dish I recommend Namaste's Say Cheez (with added bacon it is really good).",1,0
"Ok, my first exposure to yerba mate was with Rosamonte and that stuff is awesome. I had read that Canarias is the most popular seller in Uruguay and is a no-stem, high caffeine style of yerba. The flavor is quite different from Rosamonte and the density of the small cut leaves is high so you will get an occasional particle through the filter. Does seem to be more caffeine but that's just my unscientific perception. I plan to try several more brands before picking a favorite. Pretty great. It takes much more water to ""wash"" out the flavor. More economical? Try it.",4,1
"The best caramel taste, softly suck and move around in your mounth.<br />DON'T BITE even slightly WITH YOUR TEETH, resist at all costs.<br />I was looking for a caramel treat that couldn't be eaten fast... another piece, another piece and then another. This fits the bill, because you will become AFRAID TO EAT ANOTHER PIECE, BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD, LIKE BITING A TOOTSIE POP HALF WAY THROUGH, ONLY a tootsie pop isn't dangerous.<br /><br />Well, I heeded the warnings not to bite...CAUTION...DO NOT BECOME preoccupied or DISTRACTED BY something, because these stick to your teeth bigtime if you are not constantly thinking...just suck, just suck it, just suck it, resist no matter how small it gets AND remember if it does get stuck, don't pull it off, suck it off or you will have huge dentist bills and miss work.",5,1
"I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as ""Chili & Lime"".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is ""NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME"". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.",1,0

"This is delicious jerky. It's high in protein, softer and chewier than other brands, and it's relatively low in sodium for a jerky. It's easy to pack for snacks or lunches.  It keeps well so I buy it by the case and munch for a while. Excellent product for the whole family.",5,1
These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.,4,1
"This is the only tea my wife will drink.  We live in a rural area, and the several groceries which used to carry it stopped selling it.  Fortunately Amazon had it, and at a great price.  We have it delivered automatically every two months now. Great tea and the automatic delivery service is fabulous.",5,1
"The packet says ""Contains Two Servings"". The instructions call for 6 oz hot water to 3 ""heaping"" tablespoons of the cocoa powder. Both packets I opened contained less than 5 rounded tablespoons, which definitely doesn't equal ""Two Servings"". 3 heaping teaspoons makes an adequate cuppa, but only adequate. Add 1 tsp to get a good flavor. And by the way, the instructions say ""Watch it magically trun purple"" It turns an unhealthy shade of pale blue grey. Really pretty lame stuff, & the seller hasn't bothered to respond, which makes them lamer than this crap. BTW, I just hoticed that my review of this seller has ""been removed"". I didn't remove it. They are truly lame.",2,0
"I'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review. It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully's blend. I think Tully does make some of the best kcups I have had though. Love the Kona blend but now is quite expensive. This has a nice flavor to me but could be a bit stronger. That being said, if I get another deal on this blend, I will definately by it again.",4,1

The box was very cheaply made, the wood was very rough and it...looks like it will not last long and the chocolate...2 tiny little bags not as pictured at all!<br />I Will NEVER buy a product through Broadway Basketeers again nor recommend this product!<br />Amazon...you should pull the line if the this is a sample of their products.",2,0
"My quaker is a big fan of this bread. He goes for this before he goes for seed ball treats or fruit even. Plus, since switching him to Harrison's fine food, his feather plucking has greatly diminished. Hopefully the bread will continue work as a good ""treat"" and also help keep his system balanced like the regular Harrison food.<br /><br />Additionally, the package was easy to follow and the bread was super easy/quick to whip up. Only 3 additional ingredients were needed (veggie oil, water, 2 eggs. I just wish the package made a little more than one loaf (using a loaf cake pan, the bread only rose about half the way up to the top of the pan) since I'm planning on freezing it anyway.<br /><br />All in all, a great product!",5,1
I like the coffee and purchasing on Amazon.  I wish we could purchase single boxes of flavors we would like to try instead of two packs.,4,1

"I love this popcorn. A co-worker let me try some of hers, and I was instantly in love. I eat a lot of popcorn, and so far, this is my favorite microwave variety. The salt, combined with the oil cooks up nicely to give it a very savory flavor, almost like some movie theater varieties! It doesn't leave your fingers greasy or oily like a lot of other flavors. I've served this side-by-side with several other popcorns, and this is always chosen by the group as the favorite. If you're watching your sodium intake, just be mindful of how much you have per serving, but otherwise, enjoy this delicious popcorn!<br />[...]",5,1
"I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.",4,1
"Nice flavor and great value.  I roast using a Behmoor 1600 and it turns out great!  I have had several other types of beans from these guys and all were tasty, arrived on time and worth the money!  I have bought from others who also sent tasty beans, but the value from these guys can't be beat.",5,1
"Tamarined Candy is amazing. No doubt about it. However,the quality of Tamarind candy sold by Ur Asian Store is deplorable. I ordered 1 3.5 oz box and 2 4 oz boxes of Tamarind candy and instead received 3 boxes of 4 oz Tamarind candy. No problem there.  Unfortunately, the candies themselves were old, stale, and worthy of my condemnation. There was no date label on any of the three boxes so I don't know how old they were, but I felt like I was consuming Candies that were years past their ""best by"" date. After tasting 2-3 from each box I had to throw all three boxes away. My only hope now is that I will not get sick from eating these expired Tamarind Candies.<br /><br />I strongly recommend anyone interested in buying Tamarind Candy to get it from any retailer other than Ur Asian Store here on Amazon.",1,0
"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!",5,1
The first shipment was stale.  The second case was not as stale but stale nonetheless.  I'm not sure if it is staleness or just plain grossness.  I like other chips by Garden of Eatin'.  Will the birds eat them?  What do I do with all these chips?  Amazon was great about sending me a replacement when I complained about the first case.,1,0

"this candy was ok, but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at Costco, even though it was supposed to be the same flavor. But, the one in Costco said ""new improved recipe"" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor.",2,0
"I tried these and the fishy smell was VERY overpowering!!!  I rinsed and rinsed them as directed, but the smell was disgusting!  I tried to eat them and they tasted like wet, oily chewy rubber bands!  I gagged had to spit them out before I vomited!  I contacted the company to get a refund and THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY SO DONT BUY THEM!!!!!!!!!!!",1,0
I should have read the reviews on these!  About half of the chews in the bag were the thickness of a pencil.  It took my dog no more than 2 minutes to chew through one of these.  These sticks are probably cheaper at Petco.  The only reason I ordered them was to bring my Amazon order over $25 so I could get free shipping.  What a waste of money!,1,0
"Nantucket blend is robust without being harsh. I can use it on the largest setting on my Keurig, and it does not taste diluted.",5,1
"Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked ""interesting.""  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)",5,1
"Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.",5,1
"I only use Saco cocoa because it's amazing, but I don't know what going on with the price. It's almost doubled over the past 3 years or so on Amazon.

Unfortunately, my local stores here in northern California dont carry it.  Bummer.",4,1

"Suffice it to say that I am one of those middle-aged men who, when faced with the absence of snacks in the house, could eat a whole bag of walnuts with which my wife had intended to bake cookies, and then try to convince her that she forgot to add the bag to the shopping cart.  When I saw this Planters snack, I thought I'd never have to do that to her again.<br /><br />These bars are a really savory combination of sweet and salty; a good blance of the two, and the same holds true with its texture; a satisfying mixture of crisp and chewy.  Nut lovers will certainly enjoy these bars, although I thought the size of each bar was actually pretty disappointing (I see that someone added a picture of the bar as compared to a dollar bill at the top of this screen... a brilliant idea!).  The bar is actually smaller than your usual breakfast granola bar, but then again if something contains nuts as expensive as cashews, I suppose it's to be expected.<br /><br />The only thing that concerned me was the nutritional information.  For a 1.62 ounce bar, 220 calaries and 12 grams of fat is pretty steep (this coming from a guy who covers up his peanut habit to his wife over baking walnuts).<br /><br />In short, both my wife and I really enjoyed these bars, and would certainly buy them again, however we both look at them as a special treat and not a daily snack, something that will knock off hunger the way the Snickers bar is so marketed.",4,1
"this product was good quality and the price beat any retail prices I could find locally. However, half of the cans arrived substantially dented indicating either poor handling in shipping or poor packaging.",5,1

"I had just enjoyed this tea at a restaurant this evening. I enjoyed 6 or 7 cups with my meal. It does not have the bitterness that most green teas have, after leaving the bag in too long. I like to leave the bag in to get as much from the tea as I can, for the health benefits, of which there are many. I believe everyone should drink green tea, and this one tastes great. Maybe a slight bitterness but not much, it was a very smooth, fresh tasting green tea. It had that classic green tea flavor that I enjoy. As I don't care much for black or oolong teas. This was one of the best brand name green teas that I have ever had, so much that I looked it up when I got home and am now posting this review.",5,1
"If there had been more information about these olives I could have chosen better. I love the Ionian green olives so I tried another Peloponnese product. I think this is an excellent company, the olives are meaty and attractive, but I don't like olives with a bunch of dried herbs flavoring them. To their credit, that flavor is not as heavy handed as some. Oregano just seems to get stronger and stronger, and to me, very objectionable. I'm going to get some more Ionian Greens - unflavored, straight up olives. I'm sure there's room in the refrigerator for 10 pounds of olives....",2,0
"Coming back to the states after 10 years in England I was surprised that I could not find any muesli in any of my local supermarkets.  So, after trawling through Amazon I came across this product.

"Coconut oil has so many health benefits, it's really incredible!  We switched from using mainly olive oil to using this coconut oil for cooking, after learning that cooking with olive oil at high heats changes the chemical make-up of the oil into a health hazard. I had never used coconut oil before, and now I use it for everything!  Coconut oil can be substituted for butter since it is a saturated fat.  I use it for baking, stovetop cooking, and as a moistuizer for my skin (it works great, isn't real greasy, and it doesn't contain synthetic toxic ingredients like conventional lotions.) The 54 oz size is a great deal!  I can't wait till it's back in stock!",5,1
I have been giving my old golden retriever Happy Hips items for a few years now to help with his arthritis.  He loves these treats along with other Happy Hips items.

"As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better.",4,1
Some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter.<br /><br />USE A FRENCH PRESS made for coffee is a good option - dilute concentrate to desire strength. My favorite flavors are: Mango and Passion Fruit.,5,1
"Just finished dinner and figured I'd review it.  The Velveeta ultimate cheeseburger mix was relatively easy to prepare and I liked it.  I thought the cheese was just a bit sharper than typical velveeta, but I liked it.  My wife thought that it is cheesier than hamburger helper and likes this better.  I'm up for trying a couple of the other flavor mixes.  Good meal.  If you buy it I hope you enjoy and thanks for reading my review.",5,1
I have been looking for this for a long time. Tried the prepared ones and they lacked the punch that this delivers. I like the fact that you can prepare as much or as little as you need. The taste is hot enough to give heat to your food but not so much that it detracts from the taste. A definite thumbs up!,5,1
This coffee is the perfect blend of medium roast and medium boldness and intensity.  The flavour is the best hands down and I have tried many k-cups.  I bought the variety packs and this flavour was always the first to finish so now I just buy this alone. I definitely look forward to this in the morning great way to start the day.,5,1

This seems to be the biggest hit in the house and I recently went on vacation to Florida and bought some there for my family and we could not keep it in stock at the house!  From my 21 year old niece, to my 84 year old grandparents, they all loved it as well. They were all Hazelnut people, as I am as well, but this has turned in to our new fave!

Canidae Grain Free ALS Salmon formula is one of the foods I rotate for my two keeshonden girls. They love the taste and they have no digestive problems with it at all.

The pouches are convenient to pack and go. Great line of kid's food products.",5,1
"I've been a fan of Jerky for years.  I bought, tasted, and nearly gagged on the GALLOPIN' PEPPER flavor Wild Ride Jerky.  It is not spicy, it is mushy, lacks the expected standard beef jerky texture, and is like eating (I imagine) sour-ish cardboard. Save your money and pass on this one.",1,0
This is great stuff.  One of my all time favorites.  If you like strong coffee then you will like this.,5,1
"The ingredient list made for interresting reading. So much so that I almost left my first bag of these treats on the shelf. The kicker for me was that they did not contain any ingredients I am allergic to, so into my basket they went.<br /><br />Once I tried them I became addicted.  These are great right out of the bag.  I also love them in a tossed green salad with crumbled bleu cheese and thinly sliced fresh pears.<br /><br />I checked Costco yesterday for the Valdosta Blend, but they were out.  They are currently offering another Sahale blend with almonds.  I didn't buy it--I'll wait for the Valdosta to come in.  I am not sure if Costco changes the Sahale snack selection seasonally or if they were just out-of-stock.<br /><br />When we were vacationing in Texas, I bought another Sahale blend to sample.  I wish I could remember the name of it. It wasn't as good and I would not go out of my way to buy it again. I will continue to buy the Valdosta Blend regularly though.",5,1
Very tasty.  You do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor.  This is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought.  The flavor is excellent.,5,1
"This is a very nice green tea with great flavor, but the description makes it sound a bit like the REALLY green-colored tea found in sushi restaurants.  It is not - when brewed, it comes out a light brownish-green, similar (oddly) to the color of the cardboard box in the picture.  It also is not as ""grassy"" as that green tea - the flavor is definitely bolder.  Brew at about 180 for best results - if you brew in boiling water it can become bitter.  This is a great deal for green tea of this quality in this volume.  Each bag is individually sealed, which is nice although it does involve some waste of plastic.<br /><br />If you're trying to switch from coffee or black tea to green, it's hard to go wrong with this stuff.  If you are a lover of ""flavored"" teas you will probably not like this - it is JUST tea, no flavors, pure and very simple.  Also, for those who care, green tea can stain your teeth even more than coffee, strangely - be warned if you plan to drink a lot of this.  On the positive side, it won't give you that wretched coffee breath that is the bane of my office existence.",5,1
"This is ramen noodles in a big styrofoam cup, with a little sprinkle of dried vegetables, and a packet of seasoning. The seasoning is very hot and VERY salty. Not worth it, in my family's opinion. Better to buy simple ramen.",1,0
"these are not the originals they are produced in Hungary and not Germany and taste differently. There are not bad at all, but they are not the same as the originals from Germany despite the fact they are produced in a Haribo factory.",1,0
"I have purchased the regular decaf beans in the past and the coffee was very good. This time i purchased the Gorilla Decaf ground because I wanted a bolder cup of coffee, What a mistake. I have a 2 cup coffee maker were I can make a cup at a time. In order to make a good cup of coffee I have to add FOUR tablespoons of coffee and a little less water. That is crazy. I use up the coffee so fast it does not pay. Whats the Problem???????",1,0
"I wanted to breast feed, but that did not work out for a number of reasons.  We had purchased the Earth's Best to supplement.  Our daughter did very well with it and when it became apparent that we would need to do more than just supplement, we decided to stick with what was working.  Our daughter is 4 1/2 months old and she is thriving.  We appreciate that there is an alternative that is organic and that is working for her.",5,1
"If you like cracked pepper this is definitely good eats.  Not too overpowering, it's just right!",5,1
"I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These ""small"" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2...",4,1
"My cats go NUTS for these treats!!!  I've been looking for a cat treat I can give to my cat who is allergic to any type of mammal or poultry protein (have to get food from the vet) and these are just fish plus some barley and vitamins (see ingredient list).  Most treats have a chicken or beef base, even if they're fish flavored.  What a relief to find these, and the glucosamine/condroitin is just a nice bonus, since my cats are getting a bit older (9 and 14, respectively).  Oh, and did I mention they LOVE THESE TREATS?  The allergic kitty spends lots of his free time sitting in front of the cabinet where I store these treats, looking wistfully at the door.  (Um, isn't it all free time for cats?  Right.  He pretty much lives in the kitchen now...)  Try these!!",5,1
"It help clean the hard water out in my dishwater.  It did not work as good as I thought it would, but I am sure it had nothing to do with citric acid crystals.",4,1
"Yes, Fresh Step does have good odor control... But it's really, really dusty! Every time I pour it into the litterbox and whenever the cats are digging in it, there's a visible cloud of dust.  Plus the cats track it all over my wood floors.  What a mess!  I notice now that other brands of litter advertise being '99.5%' or '99.7% dustfree' on their boxes. Fresh Step has no mention of this on its box. For good reason!",1,0
I was quite happy when I typed in the Papaya Seed Dressing that Amazon found it for me.  My grandaughter brought me a packet back from Hawaii and I loved it and was elated when I found that I could order it on line.  It is a very refreshing salad dressing and I might even try it as a marinade.  I would suggest anyone who likes something different that you make from scratch to try this dressing.,5,1
"This product helps keep my mood up during stressful times, promotes sleep and good digestion.",5,1
My son eats these for breakfast every morning and he seems to really enjoy them. It is a nice alternative to fruit and rice cereal and it has all the nourishment my son needs to start his day.,5,1
"For those who like ginger, this product is fine on its own merits. However, for sushi, the product is not appropriate. For one thing, the slices are really thick and large which completely overwhelms the sushi flavour. Ginger is a supposed to be a complement to the sushi meal. The ginger should be thinly sliced, almost translucent. This is something else which is fine for other meals. For instance, I dice the slices for my other dishes.",1,0
Excellent coffee. Bold taste and great aroma. Filled the entire kitchen with a warm pumpkin spice smell. Well worth it.,5,1
"knorr shrimp bouillon cubes are irreplaceable in any sea food dish-especially shrimp or vegetable crab soup!-it is difficult to find-not sold in stores anymore,but any chef worth their salt will use this product and rave about it's superb addition to flavor in their creation!never stol making this product!",5,1
"No flavor at all, so disappointed. Bought this based on the reviews and what a waste of money. Packed in water and taste like water. Say your money.",2,0
"I made my 1st child's food using a pot of boiling water and steam basket, then transferring it to a bowl and using a kitchen aid hand blender. It was such a chore and so much clean up. I always felt I had to do 10 pounds of carrots to make it worth my time thus making it an even bigger chore and there'd be a few chunks I just couldn't get. Then of course freezing in ice cube trays and all that hassle. Plus when boiling water on the stove, I occasionally would forget about it and burn my pot. Now that I have a toddler and 6 month old and working full-time, I was tempted by the baby bullet commercials, did some research and decided to try the Beaba instead.<br /><br />I LOVE IT!!! It's no longer stressful and a huge chore. I can easily throw in a couple carrots while I'm cooking dinner for everyone else and now there's dinner for all. The food comes out so smooth. I don't have to pay attention to water boiling on the stove. I can just let it steam and it turns itself off when ready and then I can puree when I'm ready. Clean up is as easy as top rack dishwasher. I leave the lid off the water container when I'm done as I read the reviews on mold, so I've had no problems there. If you question whether to spend the money, I would say it is totally worth it. It pays for itself in a couple weeks/vs buying baby food especially if you have a big eater like I do. Highly recommend this thing.",5,1
"I made killer sloppy joes with this stuff by soaking and then mixing up as usual with my recipe ingredients. Would i want to sit down to a big bowl of plain TSP? Not so much. But with flavorings, it makes a really nicely textured ground meat analog. And it's not squeaky when you chew it.",5,1
"Great taste, great aroma! I love sprinkling a tablespoon of this cinnamon over my cereal.  It's strong, but that's the way I like it!",5,1
"They sent me the French Roast which is not a favorite of mine at all. The coffee advertises as low acid, but after two cups, I was feeling the acid. I'm sure it is most likely because of the dark roast rather than any extra acid in the coffee. The flavor is good when fresh brewed, but it doesn't sit in the pot well. It would be best for company when the whole pot will be served rather than as a daily pot for one person. It is very strong, and reminds me of New Orleans coffee without chicory.",2,0
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:17 Mins<br /><br /></span>See video. I rarely drink black tea, but for those who like it, this product will serve them well.<br /><br />I would have given it 2 stars because I really don't like black tea, but I want to be a fair tester. Someone who wants black tea will be happy with this product; hence, 4 stars. Good packaging.",4,1
I have used this product for years and it lives up to it's reputation.  Before bed it will relax you and help you sleep soundly.  I would recommend this to anyone.,5,1
"I bought these b/c I felt a sinus infection creeping up on me...spring allergies are wreaking havoc once again. I love drinking anise tea so I saw these ""Jakemans Throat and Chest"" lozenges, anise flavored, and wanted to give them a try. They are deliciously smooth and have helped soothe my sore throat and another great side effect, they have really helped clear my sinus passages too. Great little lozenges, I will keep these in my medicine cabinet for sure.",5,1
"My baby and toddler both love this baby food. I tasted the food myself, and enjoyed the taste. The other baby foods do not taste so good.",5,1
"The extra bold hints at a flavour that is strong with solid highpoints and this selecion is close to ideal. I have been using the Sumatran for a while but it was not strong enough. This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour ""grows"" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.",4,1
"When I read the directions for these cookies, I thought wow, there's going to be a lot of cookies. Wondering who I can share them with. When we baked over 4 dozed perfect mini ball cookies, I put some frosting on some and plain  powedered sugar on some too.They were amazing. Almost a dozen later, That I ate :o( but they were worth it ) I felt, I may not want to share these wonderful delghtful tresures. Luckily for me, I bought 2 bags and one was a little damaged, so I contacted the C/S and they sent me another 2 bags. C/S was great, these cookies, well lets just say one bag will not be enough. 2 bags will enough to share with the neighbors and have plenty left over.<br />Thank you, I will be ordering some sooner than later.<br />Paula",5,1
"As a long time lover of Dunkin Donuts ground coffee, I was hesitant to try something new. A woman that I was seeing from Brazil introduced me to this brew. Amazing flavor and perfect to enjoy on a leisurly weekend morning as well as during a hectic work week. I have not given up my Dunkin, but rotate in and out of both.",5,1
This is a really good popcorn.  All but a very few kernels pop per batch in my handy dandy Presto air popper.  I recommend this brand to anyone except my grandmother who has false teeth.  It is a lot to mull over.,4,1
"I love my diet big red, plain and simple. Having one is the favorite part of my day sometimes.  It's like red cream soda, but lighter tasting. A refreshing and great soft drink!",5,1
Just tried this coffee a few days ago and love it!  I like my coffee strong (will enjoy a dopio every now and then).  This coffee is strong and smooth.  I can't ask for more.,5,1
"At $34.99 for 12 pounds I did save gas money and tax. You might want to check PetSmart, Petco, PetSupermarket, etc before buying on Amazon.<br />The food itself is excellent! Our cats are doing great on Wellness Complete Health dry plus Wellness canned. Their coat has improved and they have more energy. There hasn't been any change in litter box odor. We've also noticed fewer hairballs and our ""sensitive stomach"" cat vomits less!!!",5,1
"I guess I do!  I didn't think there was a difference in ""bread"" flour, but based on many tries with many different flours and recipes for pizza on the grill this pizza flour really does make the best pizza dough.  It was easy to mix, pliable, rose very nicely, and most of all, baked very well.  I can't really believe I'm buying special flour to make pizza on the grill, but I am, and will continue to do so!",5,1
"Murphy, my soft-coated wheaten terrier LOVES these treats ... & they are healthy! He does eat them pretty quickly (he is a powerful chewer). So these are not for long-term entertainment / activity.",5,1
"I originally bought this just because it was cheaper than the regular parchment paper in the grocery store. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to find out that it's actually much more useful than regular parchment paper.<br /><br />The silicone non-stick coating is no joke. Before I got this, I would often line pans with aluminum foil and spray them with oil to roast peppers, cook frozen samosas, etc. Now, I instead just lay the food on top of a piece of parchment paper, and the non-stick coating makes oil unnecessary. And, this paper is *much* cheaper than aluminum foil.<br /><br />Two things to note: at 13"" wide, it's a couple of inches narrower than most regular parchment paper. Also, unlike most grocery store brands, it doesn't have a metal band to help you tear off sheets. (They claim that you can use the cardboard edge to do that, but it doesn't work.) But 13"" is plenty for almost everything I do. And using scissors to cut the paper is a small price to pay given how well this paper works.",5,1
"I bought this and tachino the chickory that you brew. I mix them 2 Tablespoons of the Tachino and 1 Tablespoon of Cafix and brew 3 large cups of (coffee) The first few days it took some getting used to, as it is no coffee, but I wanted to go to something more healthy and have gotten used to the taste. It did not take that much to swich and now I like it a lot! To me now it tasts like coffee, I add 1 sweet and low and a tablespoon of half and half and enjoy the smooth creamy (coffee) feel of the warm liquid in the morning. By the way if you do not like the slight bitterness add a pinch of salt before brewing to the grounds ( old swedish tradition my great grandmother used) and it take s the bitterness out. Enjoy!",4,1
"I always have Powerade in the house - for everything from the flu to overly hot baseball games, it's always been Powerade to the rescue.  The vitamins and electrolytes in this product really bring a person back together - you can even feel the hydration when you drink this stuff!  Plus, if you give this to a child after a bout with the flu, it really helps them get back on their feet a TON faster!  I put water in it for flu treatment, and ice cubes for baseball games.  This is the boys' favorite flavor - it's a bit like cherry mixed with lime, I guess is the best way to describe it.  And, it's best very, very cold.  Fabulous product, been buying it for years.  Highly HIGHLY recommend!",5,1
"I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee ""regular and black"" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.",5,1
The Neccos were exactly what I expected and fresh.  Neccos are great candies for the car as hot weather or long time not eaten does not affect them.,5,1
I thought I was doing the right thing by getting the 98% fat free turkey chili.  I was stunned when I saw that each serving has 1250 mg of sodium.  That's 2500 mgs-an entire days serving of sodium in one can.  What's the point of buying low fat chili what it'll kill you with tons of salt?,1,0
"Cugino's chicken noodle soup is pretty tasty. I used to buy it at Safeway, but they don't carry it anymore so I'm going to order it from amazon from now on. I usually add more veggies to the soup in addition to the chicken to make it a thicker, meal-type soup. I would definitely recommend this soup - it's so good!",5,1
